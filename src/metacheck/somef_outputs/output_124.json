Looking at the raw XML markup in __vim__\nI noticed a number of control code sequences. This corresponded to the errors on parsing\nthe unsanitized XML file. The problem characters appear as `^A, ^K, ^L, ^S, ^C, ^R`. These\nmaybe non-UTF-8 characters embedded as UTF-8 when the rich text documents were pasted in via\nthe LibGuides edit UI. My hunch is these were pasted in/imported from Word documents. Remove\nthe offending characters allowed the export to parse successfully. These edits are destructive\nas some of the codes probably represent UTF-8 characters used in non-English European names or\nterminology. \n"
