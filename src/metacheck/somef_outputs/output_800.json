This package was created with particular use cases in mind, and while an effort was made to generalise functionality, it may not work for every scenario. Further perspectives and applications will improve this package. \n\n## With write access\nYou can push directly to main for small fixes. Please use PRs to main for discussing larger updates.\n\n## Without write access\nCorrections, suggestions and general improvements are welcome as [issues](https://github.com/antarctica/butterfly/issues).\n\nYou can also suggest changes by forking this repository, and opening a pull request. Please target your pull requests to the main branch.\n\nIf you\u2019ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal \nreprex(this will also help you write a unit test, if needed). See the tidyverse guidance on [how to create a great issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) for more advice.\n\n### Pull request process\n\n* Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"antarctica/butterfly\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n* Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package\npasses R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n\n* Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n* Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser. The title of your PR should briefly describe the change. The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n* We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. If you create new functionality, or change existing functionality, please make sure all functionality is covered by tests, run `covr::package_coverage()` to check this.\n\n* New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://devguide.ropensci.org/maintenance_releases.html#news>.\n\n*  Before requesting a review, please make sure you have run `covr::package_coverage()`, `devtools::check()` and `pkgcheck::pkgcheck()`, as well as `devtools::build_readme`, `devtools::document()`, `devtools::build_vignettes()` or `devtools::build_site()` if you have made any changes to the README, documentation, vignettes or site.\n\n* We follow the rOpenSci guidance on [contributor attributions](https://devguide.ropensci.org/maintenance_collaboration.html#attributions). Please feel free to add yourself to the `Authors@R` field of the [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/main/DESCRIPTION) file, and specify your role (e.g. \"ctb\" for small contributions or \"aut\" for bigger contributions).\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the butterfly project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to this\nproject you agree to abide by its terms.\n"

There is therefore significant overlap, however\n  `butterfly` builds on `waldo` by providing the functionality of\n  comparing objects where we expect some changes, with previous versions\n  but not others. `butterfly` also provides extra user feedback to\n  provide clarity on what it is and isn\u2019t comparing, due to the nature\n  of comparing only \u201cmatched\u201d rows.\n- [diffdf](https://github.com/gowerc/diffdf) - similar to `waldo`, but\n  specifically for data frames, `diffdf` provides the ability to compare\n  data frames directly. We could have used `diffdf::diffdf()` in our\n  case, but we prefer `waldo`\u2019s more explicit and clear user feedback.\n  That said, there is significant overlap in functionality:\n  `butterfly::loupe()` and `diffdf::diffdf_has_issues()` both provide a\n  TRUE/FALSE difference check, while `diffdf::diffdf_issue_rows()` and\n  `butterfly::catch()` both return the rows where changes have occurred.\n  However, it lacks the flexibility of `butterfly` to compare object\n  where we expect some changes, but not others.\n- [assertr](https://github.com/tonyfischetti/assertr) - `assertr`\n  provides assertion functionality that can be used as part of a\n  pipeline, and test assertions on a particular dataset, but it does not\n  offer tools for comparison. We do highly recommend using `assertr` for\n  checks, prior to using `butterfly`, as any data quality issues will be\n  caught first.\n- [daquiri](https://github.com/ropensci/daiquiri/) - `daquiri` provides\n  tools to check data quality and visually inspect timeseries data. It\n  is also quality assurance package for timeseries, but has a very\n  different purpose to `butterfly`. \n"
