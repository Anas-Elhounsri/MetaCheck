Nevertheless, `tile` also force deletes this subdirectory immediately after its internal system call to one of the `gdal2tiles*` scripts returns, so the temporary sub-directory does not even exist for the full duration of the `tile` call.\r\n* Added functions `tile_viewer` and `view_tiles` and other supporting functions for generating HTML Leaflet tile preview web page.\r\n* Added arguments to `tile`. `tile` now generates previewer by default.\r\n* Added unit tests.\r\n* Updated vignette.\r\n",
