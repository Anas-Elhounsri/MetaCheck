If you\u2019ve found a\nbug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal \n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  \n*  Look at the GitHub build status before and after making changes.\nThe `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used\nby the package.  \n*  We recommend the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).\nYou can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to\napply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with \nyour PR.  \n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2).  \n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions\nwith test cases included are easier to accept.  \n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the\ncurrent development version header describing the changes made followed by your\nGitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the terrainr project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to this\nproject you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n### See rOpenSci [contributing guide](https://devguide.ropensci.org/contributingguide.html)\nfor further details.\n\n### Discussion forum\n\nCheck out our [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) if\n\n* you have a question, an use case, or otherwise not a bug or feature request for the software itself.\n* you think your issue requires a longer form discussion.\n\n### Prefer to Email? \n\nEmail the person listed as maintainer in the `DESCRIPTION` file of this repo.\n\nThough note that private discussions over email don't help others - of course email is totally warranted if it's a sensitive problem of any kind.\n\n### Thanks for contributing!\n\nThis contributing guide is adapted from the tidyverse contributing guide available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-lib/usethis/master/inst/templates/tidy-contributing.md \n"

All three functions\nalso have an argument, `retry` (named after the argument used in\ngenerating Docker container names) which will append a random integer\nbetween 1 and 10 to the end of each name:\n\n``` r\nmake_docker_names(1, retry = TRUE)\n#> [1] \"confident_mclean9\"\n```\n\nIn addition to these functions, proceduralnames provides the data sets\neach function draws from (namely, `docker_adjectives`, `docker_names`,\n`common_words`, and `spanish_words`). These data may evolve with each\nrelease of the package, so try not to depend on the length and contents\nof each vector remaining constant, but the fundamental shape of each\nobject will remain stable.\n\nNote that the emphasis of this package is on generating *human-readable*\nidentifiers, not necessarily universally unique strings. If you need\nstrings which are functionally universally unique for your application,\nlook into the [uuid package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=uuid).\n"
