        "value": "See also the [**poster and conference proceedings**](http://han.vandersluys.nl/en/Publications.html) we\npresented on CPV-11 in April 2015.\n\nSolTrack is a simple C/C++ routine that can compute the position of the Sun in topocentric coordinates, both\nin a [horizontal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system \"Wikipedia\") and in an\n[equatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system \"Wikipedia\") system. The code is based\non the Fortran library [libTheSky](http://libthesky.sf.net) and includes corrections for\n[aberration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_of_light \"Wikipedia\") and\n[parallax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax#Diurnal_parallax \"Wikipedia\"), and a [simple\nroutine](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986S%26T....72...70S) to correct for [atmospheric\nrefraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction \"Wikipedia\"), taking into account local\natmospheric conditions.  We compared the performance of SolTrack to detailed calculations using the planetary\ntheories [VSOP 87](http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1988A%26A...202..309B) and an [accurate\nmodel](http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/data/tn/naotn63.pdf) for atmospheric refraction.\n\n\nWe tested SolTrack for 100,000 random moments in the next 100 years (between 2017 and 2116) when the Sun is\nabove the horizon in the Netherlands (latitude &sim;52&deg;N). We find that the mean error in position is\n0.0030 &pm; 0.0016&deg;, which is sufficient for solar tracking of CPV systems under all conditions. The code\ncan compute ten million positions in 6.47 &pm; 0.03s on a single 2.67 GHz CPU core when only horizontal\ncoordinates (azimuth and altitude) are computed, and takes 8.16 &pm; 0.02s (26% slower) if\nrefraction-corrected parallactic coordinates are also calculated.  In addition to positions, SolTrack can also\ncompute the distance to the Sun, its rise, transit and set times, and its rise and set azimuth and transit\naltitude.\n\n\nWhen compared to the [PSA SunPos](http://www.psa.es/sdg/sunpos.htm) routine, which is also light-weight and\nfreely available, SolTrack is 24 times more accurate (0.073&deg;) and 2% faster. When computing additional\nrefraction-corrected equatorial coordinates, SolTrack is 23% slower than SunPos. We also compared the\nperformance of SolTrack to the [NREL SPA routine](http://www.nrel.gov/midc/spa/), which is more elaborate and\nhas a more restricted licence. SPA is 24% more accurate than SolTrack (0.0023&deg;), but also 20 times slower,\nwhere we computed only the Sun's position in SPA (not its rise and set times or incident radiation) and\nincluded the additional refraction-corrected equatorial coordinates in SolTrack.  A paper describing more\ndetails is forthcoming.\n\n"

The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3.

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.

Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"
