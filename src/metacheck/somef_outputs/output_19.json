Install Dependencies\n\n    Install all the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt:\n\n    ``` bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n    Alternatively, you can install the minimum required dependencies for DCNiOS:\n\n    ``` bash\n    pip install pyyaml==6.0 requests==2.28.2 oscar_python==1.0.3\n    ```\n4. Verify Installation\n\n    Once you've installed the dependencies. You can verify this by running a simple Python script. Try the following Python command to check if the packages are installed correctly:\n\n    ``` bash\n    python -c \"import yaml, requests, oscar_python; print('All dependencies are correctly installed.')\"\n    ```\n\n## Authors\n\n- Germ\u00e1n Molt\u00f3 mailto:gmolto@dsic.upv.es\n- Est\u00edbaliz Parcero mailto:esparig@i3m.upv.es\n- Sergio Langarita mailto:slangarita@i3m.upv.es\n\nInstituto de Instrumentaci\u00f3n para Imagen Molecular (I3M), Centro Mixto CSIC \u2014 Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia, Espa\u00f1a.\n\n\n## Versions and Maintenance\n\nThere is only one version in maintenance:\n- The main branch in the source code repository maintains a working state version of the software component.\n- Documentation is updated with the new software versions involving any substantial or minimal change in the application's behavior.

Download the repository in a local folder.\n\n    ``` bash\n    git clone git@github.com:interTwin-eu/dcnios.git\n    cd dcnios\n    ```\n\n2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):\n\n    You can choose between Conda or Venv for managing Python dependencies.\n\n    #### Using Conda\n\n    Create a new Conda environment and activate it:\n\n    ``` bash\n    conda create --name dcnios python=3.7.6\n    conda activate dcnios\n    ```\n\n    #### Using Venv\n\n    Create a virtual environment with Venv and activate it:\n\n    ``` bash\n    python -m venv dcniosenv\n    source dcniosenv/bin/activate\n    ```\n\n3. Install Dependencies\n\n    Install all the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt:\n\n    ``` bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n    Alternatively, you can install the minimum required dependencies for DCNiOS:\n\n    ``` bash\n    pip install pyyaml==6.0 requests==2.28.2 oscar_python==1.0.3\n    ```\n4. Verify Installation\n\n    Once you've installed the dependencies. You can verify this by running a simple Python script. Try the following Python command to check if the packages are installed correctly:\n\n    ``` bash\n    python -c \"import yaml, requests, oscar_python; print('All dependencies are correctly installed.')\"\n    ```\n\n## Authors\n\n- Germ\u00e1n Molt\u00f3 mailto:gmolto@dsic.upv.es\n- Est\u00edbaliz Parcero mailto:esparig@i3m.upv.es\n- Sergio Langarita mailto:slangarita@i3m.upv.es\n\nInstituto de Instrumentaci\u00f3n para Imagen Molecular (I3M), Centro Mixto CSIC \u2014 Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia, Espa\u00f1a.\n\n\n## Versions and Maintenance\n\nThere is only one version in maintenance:\n- The main branch in the source code repository maintains a working state version of the software component.\n- Documentation is updated with the new software versions involving any substantial or minimal change in the application's behavior.

In the OSCAR cluster, a user-defined service creates a job to process the stored data.\n\n![DCNiOS Workflow](docpage/docs/images/dcnios-workflow.png)\n\nTherefore, DCNiOS has been made to interact with NiFi and deploy a complete dataflow. It uses HTTP calls to communicate with a Nifi cluster. \n\nApache NiFi can be automatically deployed using the [Infrastructure Manager (IM)](https://im.egi.eu) on a dynamically provisioned Kubernetes Cluster. **Note** that a NiFi registry is not required.\n\n## Achievements\n\n<a href=\"https://eu.badgr.com/public/assertions/0vLlQBANQzyHMOrmcsck3w?identity__url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FEOSC-synergy%2Foscar.assess.sqaaas%2Fcommit%2F10254d15a9230f45c84dae22f3711653162faf78\">\n<img src=\"docpage/docs/images/badge_software_silver.png\" alt=\"Silver Badge\" width=\"250\"></a>\n\nThis software has received a silver badge according to the [Software Quality Baseline criteria](https://www.eosc-synergy.eu/for-developers/) defined by the [EOSC-Synergy](https://www.eosc-synergy.eu) project.\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- OSCAR cluster with services deployed.\n- NiFi Cluster deployed.\n- A Python distribution such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).\n\n### Installation\n\n1. Download the repository in a local folder.\n\n    ``` bash\n    git clone git@github.com:interTwin-eu/dcnios.git\n    cd dcnios\n    ```\n\n2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):\n\n    You can choose between Conda or Venv for managing Python dependencies.\n\n    #### Using Conda\n\n    Create a new Conda environment and activate it:\n\n    ``` bash\n    conda create --name dcnios python=3.7.6\n    conda activate dcnios\n    ```\n\n    #### Using Venv\n\n    Create a virtual environment with Venv and activate it:\n\n    ``` bash\n    python -m venv dcniosenv\n    source dcniosenv/bin/activate\n    ```\n\n3. Install Dependencies\n\n    Install all the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt:\n\n    ``` bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n    Alternatively, you can install the minimum required dependencies for DCNiOS:\n\n    ``` bash\n    pip install pyyaml==6.0 requests==2.28.2 oscar_python==1.0.3\n    ```\n4. Verify Installation\n\n    Once you've installed the dependencies. You can verify this by running a simple Python script. Try the following Python command to check if the packages are installed correctly:\n\n    ``` bash\n    python -c \"import yaml, requests, oscar_python; print('All dependencies are correctly installed.')\"\n    ```\n\n## Authors\n\n- Germ\u00e1n Molt\u00f3 mailto:gmolto@dsic.upv.es\n- Est\u00edbaliz Parcero mailto:esparig@i3m.upv.es\n- Sergio Langarita mailto:slangarita@i3m.upv.es\n\nInstituto de Instrumentaci\u00f3n para Imagen Molecular (I3M), Centro Mixto CSIC \u2014 Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia, Espa\u00f1a.\n\n\n## Versions and Maintenance\n\nThere is only one version in maintenance:\n- The main branch in the source code repository maintains a working state version of the software component.\n- Documentation is updated with the new software versions involving any substantial or minimal change in the application's behavior. Any issue can be reported in the [Issues section of the GitHub project](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/dcnios/issues).\n- Documentation is updated whenever reported as inaccurate or unclear.\n\n## Licensing\n\nDCNiOS is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
