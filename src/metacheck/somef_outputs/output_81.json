If you\u2019ve found a\nbug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal\n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).\n\n### Pull request process\n\n- We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).\n- Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.\n  The `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used\n  by the package.\n- We use [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) to format our code.\n  Please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.\n- We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2).\n- We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions\n  with test cases included are easier to accept.\n- For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the\n  current development version header describing the changes made followed by your\n  GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the {hagis} project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
