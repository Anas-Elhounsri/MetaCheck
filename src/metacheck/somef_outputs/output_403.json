If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"mikemahoney218/unifir\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the unifir project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to this\nproject you agree to abide by its terms.\n"

        "value": "\nunifir is a unifying API for creating and managing\n[Unity](https://unity.com/) scenes directly from R (without requiring\nGUI interaction). Users are able to write natural-feeling R code to\ncreate \u201cscripts\u201d (C# programs) composed of \u201cprops\u201d (C# methods) which\nproduce scenes inside the Unity engine. While it is entirely possible to\ncreate fleshed-out Unity scenes through this package, unifir is\nprimarily designed around being easy to wrap in other packages, so that\nany number of packages interacting with Unity can all share a common\nframework. \nOpen your new project from UnityHub, open the scene you created with\n`save_scene`, and you\u2019ll see the outputs from your script right in front\nof you! To learn more, check out the vignettes that ship with the\npackage \u2013 particularly [the one for how to use unifir to make\nscenes](https://docs.ropensci.org/unifir/articles/unifir-user-guide.html)\nand [the one for how to extend unifir in your own\npackages](https://docs.ropensci.org/unifir/articles/unifir-dev-guide.html). \nRight now, unifir wraps the elements of the Unity API that I\u2019ve found\nuseful in my own work, principally focused around creating GameObjects,\nlights, player controllers, and terrain surfaces. If you are interested\nin pieces of the API that haven\u2019t made it into unifir yet, please open\nan issue or a PR!\n \n"

        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "There\u2019s been a lot of interest in using immersive virtual environments\nfor research on topics including [science\ncommunication](https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2020.1830997),\n[landscape planning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.102102),\n[environmental economics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2008.08.002)\nand beyond. This is an incredibly exciting area of research, which looks\nlikely to present new methods for participatory planning, data\nvisualization, and skill training. However, right now, much of the\nresearch in this area relies upon closed-source tooling which puts up\nhurdles in front of the equitability, accessibility, and\ninteroperability of the field. In addition, a challenge when assessing\nhand-build environments (say to assess participant preferences between\ntwo scenes) is that us as researchers might accidentally \u201ctilt the\nscales\u201d in favor of our preferred option, by putting a little more\neffort into making the scene we personally prefer look more\naesthetically pleasing than the alternative. \nunifir is a first step towards an open-source, fully reproducible\napproach for constructing immersive virtual environments. While it\ncurrently only targets Unity, a proprietary source-available game\nengine, unifir hopes to improve the openness and interoperability of\nimmersive virtual environments by encoding all of the decisions involved\nin building a scene in standard R and C# code. A partially open system\nis better than a fully closed one, and if other game engines become more\nfeasible options for large scale immersive virtual environments, unifir\nmay be extended to support those as well.\n \n"

        "description": "# unifir 0.2.0\r\n\r\nThis is the first version of unifir to land on CRAN\r\n\r\n* Improvements and bug fixes:\r\n    * `find_unity()` now doesn't escape its Unity path (so the string returned \r\n      is the actual path to the Unity engine, not a quoted version). \r\n      Accordingly, `action()` now wraps `unity` in `shQuote()`. (#4)\r\n    * `add_default_tree()` now imports its trees standing upright by default. \r\n      If you manually set `x_rotation` to 0, however, the trees will import as \r\n      sideways as ever. (#7)\r\n    * Examples are now tested (and work) (#8 1d5b1f3)\r\n    * `create_terrain()` handles non-local terrain files (#6)\r\n    * `unifir_prop()` now checks to make sure `script` exists and is a \r\n      `unifir_script`. Previously this errored with a baffling message about\r\n      long vectors.\r\n* Documentation changes:\r\n    * Vignettes have been fleshed out, and a full example added to the \r\n      user-facing vignette. (#7)\r\n    * Return values are better documented (#5)\r\n    * Functions are consistently linked and documentation formatting is now\r\n      more consistent (#5)\r\n    * `find_unity()` doesn't now have a weird break in its documentation \r\n      sections\r\n    * The README now links to vignettes and explains why anyone would want\r\n      to deal with Unity in the first place",
