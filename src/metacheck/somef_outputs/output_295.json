These files can be found in [final_count_taxonomy_fasta_files](https://github.com/arms-mbon/code_release_001/tree/main/final_count_taxonomy_fasta_files). Note that the ASVs/OTUs there do NOT equal the ASV/OTU IDs in the PEMA output files. New IDs were re-assigned after merging all data of all PEMA runs for each gene. \nThe R script [gene_analysis.R](https://github.com/arms-mbon/code_release_001/blob/main/gene_analysis.R) uses the files found in [final_count_taxonomy_fasta_files](https://github.com/arms-mbon/code_release_001/tree/main/final_count_taxonomy_fasta_files), the [sample_data.txt](https://github.com/arms-mbon/code_release_001/blob/main/sample_data.txt) and the [palette.txt](https://github.com/arms-mbon/code_release_001/blob/main/palette.txt) file and performs all subsequent exploration of the sequencing data as presented in the manuscript, including: \n* removal of certain samples/replicates and erroneous/contaminant sequences\n* manual correction of phylum level assignments\n* generating all data/results presented in the mansucript\n* generating species occurrences (i.e., species occurrences with at least two sequence reads of COI and 18S data; data of each gene were then pooled) to screen for sensitive, non-indigenous and red-listed taxa (see below for respective code of the actual screening process)\n* statistics\n* generating plots \n"

Useage of the code is documented within the code. You run this on the command line, with the input file name and column number with the AphiaIDs written into the top of the code.

This specific version outputs some of the input columns in addition to what is computed by the code.\n* The resulting files are [SpeciesListAttributesCOI.csv](https://github.com/arms-mbon/code_release_001/blob/main/SpeciesListAttributesCOI.csv) and [SpeciesListAttributes18S.csv](https://github.com/arms-mbon/code_release_001/blob/main/SpeciesListAttributes18S.csv). \nThe files resulting from the database scans are read into R within the [gene_analysis.R](https://github.com/arms-mbon/code_release_001/blob/main/gene_analysis.R) script and processed further for analysis and visualisation. \n"
