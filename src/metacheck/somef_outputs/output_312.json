Scientific\napplication can greatly benefit from this event-driven computing paradigm in\norder to trigger on demand the execution of a resource-intensive application\nthat requires processing a certain file that was just uploaded to a storage\nservice. This requires additional support for the execution of generic\napplications in existing open-source FaaS frameworks. \nWith OSCAR, users upload files to a data storage back-end and this automatically\ntriggers the execution of parallel invocations to a service responsible for\nprocessing each file. Output files are delivered into a data storage back-end\nfor the convenience of the user. The user only specifies the Docker image and\nthe script to be executed, inside a container created out of that image, \nto process a file that will be automatically made available to the\ncontainer. The deployment of the computing infrastructure and its scalability\nis abstracted away from the user. Synchronous invocations are also supported to create \nscalable HTTP-based endpoints for triggering containerised applications.\n \n"
