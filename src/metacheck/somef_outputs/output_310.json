We now check if \n  port 22 is open and error with informative message about waiting \n  a bit for it to open (#113) thanks @fmichonneau @hrbrmstr\n- Fixed problem in the `print.droplet` due to problem in `droplet_ip()` internal function (#109)\n- Fix to `*_create` to allow flexibility in how often DO API is pinged. \n  Previously we pinged every second, meaning you could hit your API rate limit\n  fastish. Now you can set an option `do.wait_time` to tweak time \n  bewtween pings to check for droplet creation (or other actions). \n  See https://github.com/sckott/analogsea/issues/108#issuecomment-151519855\n  for example of doing droplet creation in parallel.
