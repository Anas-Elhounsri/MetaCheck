Care has been taken to keep _dataset_ simple enough and light weight enough that it will run on a machine as small as a Raspberry Pi Zero while being equally  comfortable on a more resource rich server or desktop environment. _dataset_ can be re-implement in any programming language supporting file input and output, common string operations and along with JSON encoding and decoding functions. The current  implementation is in the Go language.\n \n"

Here's a general guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Download the Executable**: First, download the unsigned executable file you want to install.\n\n2. **Locate the File**: Use Finder to locate the downloaded file. It's often in the `Downloads` folder unless you specified a different location.\n\n3. **Attempt to Open the File**: Double-click the file to open it. macOS will likely show a warning that the file cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.\n\n4. **Override Security Settings**:\n   - **Option 1: Open via Context Menu**\n     - Right-click (or Control-click) the file.\n     - Select `Open` from the context menu.\n     - You'll see another warning, but this time there will be an option to `Open` the file anyway. Click `Open`.\n\n   - **Option 2: Allow Apps from Anywhere (Temporarily)**\n     - Open `System Preferences` and go to `Security & Privacy`.\n     - Click the lock icon in the bottom left corner and enter your password to make changes.\n     - Under the `General` tab, you might see a message about the app being blocked. Click `Open Anyway`.\n     - If you don't see this option, you can temporarily change the setting to allow apps downloaded from `Anywhere`. However, this option is not available in the latest versions of macOS by default. You may need to use the Terminal to do this:\n       - Open Terminal and type: `sudo spctl --master-disable`\n       - Press Enter and provide your password.\n       - This will allow you to run apps from anywhere, but it's recommended to re-enable security by typing `sudo spctl --master-enable` after installing your app.\n\n5. **Use Terminal (Advanced Users)**: If the above methods don't work, you can use the Terminal to run the executable directly:\n   - Open Terminal.\n   - Navigate to the directory where the file is located using the `cd` command.\n   - Make the file executable by typing: `chmod +x filename`\n   - Run the file by typing: `./filename`\n\n6. **Check for Updates**: Sometimes, developers will sign their apps later. Check if there's a signed version available to avoid these steps in the future.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Security Risks**: Running unsigned executables can expose your system to malware and other security risks. Only proceed if you trust the source of the software.\n- **System Integrity Protection (SIP)**: Some steps might be restricted by SIP, which is designed to protect your system. Disabling SIP is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.\n\nIf you're unsure about any of these steps or the safety of the file, it's best to consult with someone who has more experience with macOS or to contact the software developer for support.\n"

Here's a general guide on how to do it:\n\n### Steps to Install an Unsigned Executable on Windows\n\n1. **Download the Executable**: Download the unsigned executable file you want to install from a trusted source.\n\n2. **Locate the File**: Use File Explorer to locate the downloaded file, which is often in the `Downloads` folder unless you specified a different location.\n\n3. **Attempt to Open the File**: Double-click the file to open it. Windows may show a warning that the file is not commonly downloaded and could harm your computer.\n\n4. **Override Security Settings**:\n   - **Option 1: Run Anyway**\n     - When you see the warning, click on `More info` in the dialog box.\n     - A new option will appear to `Run anyway`. Click this to proceed with the installation.\n\n   - **Option 2: Disable Windows Defender SmartScreen (Temporarily)**\n     - Open the Start menu and go to `Settings`.\n     - Navigate to `Update & Security` > `Windows Security` > `App & browser control`.\n     - Under `Check apps and files`, select `Off`. This will disable SmartScreen temporarily.\n     - Try running the executable again.\n     - Remember to turn SmartScreen back on after installation for continued protection.\n\n5. **Use Command Prompt (Advanced Users)**: If the above methods don't work, you can use the Command Prompt to run the executable directly:\n   - Open Command Prompt as an administrator.\n   - Navigate to the directory where the file is located using the `cd` command.\n   - Run the file by typing its name and pressing Enter.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Security Risks**: Running unsigned executables can expose your system to malware and other security risks. Only proceed if you trust the source of the software.\n- **User Account Control (UAC)**: UAC might prompt you for permission to run the executable. Ensure you have administrative rights to proceed.\n- **Antivirus Software**: Your antivirus software might also block unsigned executables. You may need to temporarily disable it or add an exception for the file.\n\nIf you're unsure about any of these steps or the safety of the file, it's best to consult with someone who has more experience with Windows or to contact the software developer for support."

The resulted in mitigation steps of ignoring the version.json file held in the collection's root directory. As of v2.3 this file is no longer read or updated. Instead the collection level methods will explicitly set the versioning type at the store level. This means one locations holds versioning state, the collection.json.
