Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of\nactions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels\nlike social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent\nban.\n\n### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the\ncommunity.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 2.1, available at\n<https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html>.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by\n[Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder][https://github.com/mozilla/inclusion].\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\n<https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq>.

We are not directly funded to do so.\n\n[repo]: https://github.com/inbo/camtrapdp\n[issues]: https://github.com/inbo/camtrapdp/issues\n[new_issue]: https://github.com/inbo/camtrapdp/issues/new\n[website]: https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp\n[citation]: https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/authors.html\n[email]: mailto:damiano.oldoni@inbo.be\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nPlease note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n## How you can contribute\n\nThere are several ways you can contribute to this project. If you want to know more about why and how to contribute to open source projects like this one, see this [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).\n\n### Share the love \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThink camtrapdp is useful? Let others discover it, by telling them in person, via Twitter or a blog post.\n\nUsing camtrapdp for a paper you are writing? Consider [citing it][citation].\n\n### Ask a question \u2049\ufe0f\n\nUsing camtrapdp and got stuck? Browse the [documentation][website] to see if you can find a solution. Still stuck? Post your question as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we cannot offer user support, we'll try to do our best to address it, as questions often lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.\n\nWant to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer by [email][mailto:email].\n\n### Propose an idea \ud83d\udca1\n\nHave an idea for a new camtrapdp feature? Take a look at the [documentation][website] and [issue list][issues] to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:\n\n* Explain in detail how it would work.\n* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.\n\nSee below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.\n\n### Report a bug \ud83d\udc1b\n\nUsing camtrapdp and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:\n\n* Your operating system name and version (e.g. Mac OS 10.13.6).\n* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.\n* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.\n\n### Improve the documentation \ud83d\udcd6\n\nNoticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!\n\n#### The website\n\n[This website][website] is generated with [`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don't have to write any html: content is pulled together from documentation in the code, vignettes, [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files, the package `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you know your way around `pkgdown`, you can [propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to improve documentation. If not, [report an issue][new_issue] and we can point you in the right direction.\n\n#### Function documentation\n\nFunctions are described as comments near their code and translated to documentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/). If you want to improve a function description:\n\n1. Go to `R/` directory in the [code repository][repo].\n2. Look for the file with the name of the function.\n3. [Propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with `#'`).\n\n### Contribute code \ud83d\udcdd\n\nCare to fix bugs or implement new functionality for camtrapdp? Awesome! \ud83d\udc4f Have a look at the [issue list][issues] and leave a comment on the things you want to work on. See also the development guidelines below.\n\n## Development guidelines\n\nWe try to follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.\n\n1. Fork [this repo][repo] and clone it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).\n2. If you have forked and cloned the project before and it has been a while since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/) to your clone by using `git pull upstream main`.\n3. Open the RStudio project file (`.Rproj`).\n4. Make your changes:\n    * Write your code.\n    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).\n    * Document your code (see function documentation above).\n    * Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors and warnings.\n5. Commit and push your changes.\n6. Submit a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).\n"

The internal function `convert()` has been renamed to `upgrade()` (#113).\n* New `write_camtrapdp()` writes a Camera Trap Data Package to disk as a `datapackage.json` and CSV files (#137). This means you can now read, update and write Camtrap DP datasets.\n\n## Accessing data\n\n* New `contributors()` returns a tibble with contributors (#140).\n* New `individuals()` returns a data frame with unique individuals (#149).\n* `taxa()` now removes duplicates (#130).\n\n## Filtering data\n\n* `filter_deployments()` and `deployments()<-` now update the spatial, temporal and taxonomic scope in the metadata based on the returned data (#100, #132).\n* `filter_observations()`, `filter_media()`, `media()<-` and `observations()<-` now update the taxonomic scope in the metadata based on the returned data (#89, #100, #130).\n\n## Transforming data\n\n* `write_dwc()` now adds `identificationVerificationStatus` for observations classified by humans with 100% certainty (#158).\n* `write_dwc()` now allows to create occurrences from media-based observations (#172).\n* New `write_eml()` transforms Camtrap DP metadata to EML (#99). This function is used by GBIF to create metadata for a dataset page.\n* New `merge_camtrapdp()` allows to merge two datasets (#112). This can be useful to combine data from multiple studies.\n* New `round_coordinates()` allows to fuzzy/generalize location information by rounding deployment `latitude` and `longitude`. It also updates `coordinateUncertainty` in the deployments and `coordinatePrecision` and spatial scope in the metadata (#106).\n* New `shift_time()` allows to shift/correct date-times in data and metadata for specified deploymentIDs and duration (#108).\n* New `update_taxon()` allows to update taxonomic information in data and metadata (#159).  \n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n* camtrapdp now relies on (and is tested for) R version 3.6.0 or higher (#138).\n* Internal function `build_taxa()` is renamed to `taxonomic()` (#130).\n",

        "value": "With camtrapdp you can **read** a Camtrap DP dataset into your R\nenvironment:\n\n``` r\nlibrary(camtrapdp, warn.conflicts = FALSE)\n\nfile <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdwg/camtrap-dp/1.0/example/datapackage.json\"\nx <- read_camtrapdp(file)\nx\n#> A Camera Trap Data Package \"camtrap-dp-example-dataset\" with 3 tables:\n#> \u2022 deployments: 4 rows\n#> \u2022 media: 423 rows\n#> \u2022 observations: 549 rows\n#> \n#> And 1 additional resource:\n#> \u2022 individuals\n#> Use `unclass()` to print the Data Package as a list.\n```\n\n`read_camtrapdp()` will automatically **upgrade** an older version of\nCamtrap DP to the latest version. It will also make the data easier to\nuse, by assigning taxonomic information (found in the metadata) to the\nobservations and `eventID`s (found in the observations) to the media.\n\nTo **access** the data, use one of the [accessor\nfunctions](https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/reference/index.html#accessor-and-assignment-functions)\nlike `locations()`:\n\n``` r\nlocations(x)\n#> # A tibble: 4 \u00d7 5\n#>   locationID locationName               latitude longitude coordinateUncertainty\n#>   <chr>      <chr>                         <dbl>     <dbl>                 <dbl>\n#> 1 e254a13c   B_HS_val 2_processiepark       51.5      4.77                   187\n#> 2 2df5259b   B_DL_val 5_beek kleine vi\u2026     51.2      5.66                   187\n#> 3 ff1535c0   B_DL_val 3_dikke boom          51.2      5.66                   187\n#> 4 ce943ced   B_DM_val 4_'t WAD              50.7      4.01                   187\n```\n\nYou can also **filter** data with one of the [filter\nfunctions](https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/reference/index.html#filter-functions),\nwhich automatically filter the related data. For example, here we filter\nobservations on scientific name(s) and return the associated events in\nthat subset:\n\n``` r\nx %>%\n  filter_observations(\n    scientificName %in% c(\"Martes foina\", \"Mustela putorius\")\n  ) %>%\n  events()\n#> # A tibble: 4 \u00d7 4\n#>   deploymentID eventID  eventStart          eventEnd           \n#>   <chr>        <chr>    <dttm>              <dttm>             \n#> 1 577b543a     976129e2 2020-06-19 22:31:51 2020-06-19 22:31:56\n#> 2 577b543a     b4b39b00 2020-06-23 23:33:53 2020-06-23 23:33:58\n#> 3 577b543a     5be4f4ed 2020-06-28 22:01:12 2020-06-28 22:01:18\n#> 4 577b543a     a60816f2 2020-06-28 23:33:16 2020-06-28 23:33:22\n```\n\nFor more functionality, see the [function\nreference](https://inbo.github.io/camtrapdp/reference/index.html).\n"
