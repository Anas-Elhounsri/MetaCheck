        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "Each directory will contain an [EPrints XML](https://wiki.eprints.org/w/XML_Export_Format) file and additional document file(s) associated with the EPrints record in question.  Documents associated with each record will be fetched over the network.  The list of documents for each record is determined from XML file, in the `<documents>` element.  Certain EPrints internal documents such as `indexcodes.txt` and preview images are ignored. \nThe type of archive made when `bag-and-archive` mode is used for the `-b` option can be changed using the option `-t` (or `/t` on Windows).  The possible values are: `compressed-zip`, `uncompressed-zip`, `compressed-tar`, and `uncompressed-tar`.  As mentioned above, the default is `uncompressed-zip` (used if no `-t` option is given).  [ZIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)) is the default because it is more widely recognized and supported than [tar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) format, and _uncompressed_ ZIP is used because file corruption is generally more damaging to a compressed archive than an uncompressed one.  Since the main use case for `eprints2bags` is to archive contents for long-term storage, avoiding compression seems safer. \nThe ZIP archive file will be written with a text comment describing the contents of the archive.  This comment can be viewed by ZIP utilities (e.g., using `zipinfo -z` on Unix/Linux and macOS).  The following is an example of a comment and the information it contains:\n```\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nAbout this archive file:\n\nThis is an archive of a file directory organized in BagIt v1.0 format.\nThe bag contains the content from the EPrints record located at\nhttp://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:SHIjfm98\n\nThe software used to create this archive file was:\neprints2bags version 1.3.1 <https://github.com/caltechlibrary/eprints2bags>\n\nThe following is the metadata contained in bag-info.txt:\nBag-Software-Agent: bagit.py v1.7.0 <https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python>\nBagging-Date: 2018-12-13\nExternal-Description: Archive of EPrints record and document files\nExternal-Identifier: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:SHIjfm98\nInternal-Sender-Identifier: https://authors.library.caltech.edu/id/eprint/355\nPayload-Oxum: 4646541.2\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n```\n \nFinally, the overall collection of EPrints records (whether the records are bagged and archived, or just bagged, or left as-is) can optionally be itself put into a bag and/or put in a ZIP archive.  This behavior can be changed with the option `-e` (`/e` on Windows).  Like `-b`, this option takes the possible values `none`, `bag`, and `bag-and-archive`.  The default is `none`.  If the value `bag` is used, a top-level bag containing the individual EPrints bags is created out of the output directory (the location given by the `-o` option); if the value `bag-and-archive` is used, the bag is also put into a single-file archive.  (In other words, the result will be a ZIP archive of a bag whose data directory contains other ZIP archives of bags.)  For safety, `eprints2bags` will refuse to do `bag` or `bag-and-archive` unless a separate output directory is given via the `-o` option; otherwise, this would restructure the current directory where `eprints2bags` is running &ndash; with potentially unexpected or even catastrophic results.  (Imagine if the current directory were the user's home directory!) \n"

If you encounter file system limitations on the number of subdirectories that can be created, a simple solution is to manually create an intermediate level of subdirectories under the destination given to `-o`, then run `eprints2bags` multiple times, each time indicating a different subrange of records to the `-i` option and a different subdirectory to `-o`, such that the number of records written to each destination is below the file system's limit on total number of directories. \n"

The original code is still available in this repository in the [historical](historical) subdirectory.  In late 2018, Mike Hucka sought to expand the functionality of the original tools and generalize them in anticipation of having to stop using DPN because on 2018-12-04, DPN announced they were shutting down. Thus was born _Eprints2bags_. \n"

If you don't have the `pip` package or are uncertain if you do, first run the following command in a terminal command line interpreter: \n```\nsudo python3 -m ensurepip\n```\n\nThen, to install `eprints2bags` from the Python package repository, run the following command:\n```\npython3 -m pip install eprints2bags --user --upgrade\n```\n\nAs an alternative to getting it from PyPI, you can instruct `pip` to install `eprints2bags` directly from the GitHub repository:\n```sh\npython3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/caltechlibrary/eprints2bags.git --user --upgrade\n```\n\nOn Linux and macOS systems, assuming that the installation proceeds normally, you should end up with a program called `eprints2bags` in a location normally searched by your terminal shell for commands.\n\n"

The behavior change of `-@` is not backward compatible.\r\n* Internally, package metadata is now stored in `setup.cfg`.  Also, there is no `eprints2bags/__version__.py` anymore, and instead, some special code in `eprints2bags/__init__.py` extracts package-level variables directly from the installation created by `pip`.\r\n* Redesigned the icon for `eprints2bags` to tie into Eprints a little bit better.\r\n* Changed Caltech logo used on the bottom of the README.md file.  The previous logo is only approved by Caltech for use in certain official contexts.\r\n* Fixed various small errors in the README.md file.\r\n* Released on PyPI.\r\n\r\nThe file [CHANGES](CHANGES.md) contains a more complete change log that includes information about previous releases.",

First, if desired, `eprints2bags` can now create a top-level bag containing the archived bags it creates.  This top-level bag itself can also be put into a single-file archive if desired.  This behavior is controlled by the new option `-e` in combination with the (renamed) option `-b` and the new option `-t`.  (The default behavior remains _not_ to create an overall bag or archive.)  Along with these changes, several existing command-line arguments have changed names and abbreviations.  Please see the help text for the new names.  Finally, a new option `-c` is available for changing the number of processes used during the bagging step to calculate checksums, and `eprints2bags` now uses multiple processes for that step by default.\r\n\r\nThe file [CHANGES](CHANGES.md) contains a more complete change log that includes information about previous releases.",

When this option is given, `eprints2bags` will only keep those records having a status value that appears in the comma-separated argument to `-s`.  Putting a caret character (`^`) in front of the status (or status list) negates the sense, so that `eprints2bags` will only keep those records whose `<eprints_status>` field value is *not* among those given.  Examples: `eprints2bags -s archive -a ...` or `eprints2bags -s ^inbox,buffer,deletion -a ...`.\r\n* The file comments written to the ZIP archive file have been corrected to state the version of the BagIt format that is actually being used.

        "value": "The EPrints records to be written will be limited to the list of EPrints numbers found in the file given by the option `-i` (or `/i` on Windows).  If no `-i` option is given, this program will download all the contents available at the given EPrints server.  The value of `-i` can also be one or more integers separated by commas (e.g., `-i 54602,54604`), or a range of numbers separated by a dash (e.g., `-i 1-100`, which is interpreted as the list of numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 inclusive), or some combination thereof.  In those cases, the records written will be limited to those numbered.\n\nIf the `-l` option (or `/l` on Windows) is given, the records will be additionally filtered to return only those whose last-modified date/time stamp is no older than the given date/time description.  Valid descriptors are those accepted by the Python [dateparser](https://pypi.org/project/dateparser/) library.  Make sure to enclose descriptions within single or double quotes.  Examples:\n\n```\neprints2bags -l \"2 weeks ago\" -a ....\neprints2bags -l \"2014-08-29\"  -a ....\neprints2bags -l \"12 Dec 2014\" -a ....\neprints2bags -l \"July 4, 2013\" -a ....\n```\n\nIf the `-s` option (or `/s` on Windows) is given, the records will also be filtered to include only those whose `<eprint_status>` element value is one of the listed status codes.  Comparisons are done in a case-insensitive manner.  Putting a caret character (`^`) in front of the status (or status list) negates the sense, so that `eprints2bags` will only keep those records whose `<eprint_status>` value is _not_ among those given.  Examples:\n\n```\neprints2bags -s archive -a ...\neprints2bags -s ^inbox,buffer,deletion -a ...\n```\n\nBoth lastmod and status filering are done after the `-i` argument is processed.\n\nBy default, if an error occurs when requesting a record from the EPrints server, it stops execution of `eprints2bags`.  Common causes of errors include missing records implied by the arguments to `-i`, missing files associated with a given record, and files inaccessible due to permissions errors.  If the option `-k` (or `/k` on Windows) is given, `eprints2bags` will attempt to keep going upon encountering missing records, or missing files within records, or similar errors.  Option `-k` is particularly useful when giving a range of numbers with the `-i` option, as it is common for EPrints records to be updated or deleted and gaps to be left in the numbering.  (Running without `-i` will skip over gaps in the numbering because the available record numbers will be obtained directly from the server, which is unlike the user providing a list of record numbers that may or may not exist on the server.  However, even without `-i`, errors may still result from permissions errors or other causes.)\n\n"
