If you haven't already, please check out the [getting stated](https://weecology.github.io/portalcasting/articles/getting_started.html) for general info about setting up the project.\n\n## Contributor Code of Conduct\nAll contributors will be expected to follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Workflow\n####  For the General Public\nIf you're not a member of the Weecology lab, we ask that you use one of the following two methods for contributing:\n\n1. Create an issue -- if you spot any typos, bugs, or have general suggestions, etc. You can also use this to participate in ongoing discussions. For more info, please check out this Github [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).\n\n2. Fork weecology/portalcasting and clone your copy. Use a branch to add contributions and create a pull request -- if you have suggested bugfixes or changes. For more info, please check out this Github [guide](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). We ask that you follow our guidelines below on documentation and testing.  \n\nWe use the R package `devtools` to install, build, and test the changes in the repository: \n\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ninstall.packages(\".\", repos = NULL, type=\"source\", quiet = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)\nlibrary(portalcasting)\n```\n\n#### Weecologists\n\nIf you're actively working on this repo, then you should have write access to create branches for any new features or bugfixes. Please see the lab-wiki for info on using branches in a shared repository. \n\nIf you don't have write access and you would like to, please contact @gmyenni for access.\n\n## Documentation\n\nIf you are contributing code to this project, you generally don't need any additional packages, since the documentation will be written as comments in the R scripts. If you are also building the package, see the [section below](#building) for more details.\n\nIn most cases, you'll be creating a new function and then documenting it. You can check the existing functions for examples, but here's a basic template:\n```\n#' @title {this is the heading for the help file}\n#'\n#' @description {A description of the function}\n#'\n#' @param {name of a function argument} {what the argument does}\n#'\n#' @return {what is returned from the function}\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' {R code that is an example use of the function}\n#'\n#' @export\n#'\nnewfunc <- function() ...\n```\n\nNote that you can also include links to other functions, math formatting, and more. For more details, see the [chapter on documentation ](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html) in Hadley Wickham's book for R packages.\n\n\n## Building\n\nTo fully build the package, including documentation, running-tests, you will need the `roxygen2`, the `testthat`, and the `devtools` package.\n\nSpecific operations are then done by calling the appropriate functions from within R, while your working directory is somewhere in the package folder.\n\nThe suggested workflow is:\n1. Write code, documentation, and tests.\n2. Run `devtools::document()` to generate the documentation files and update the `NAMESPACE` file.\n3. Run `devtools::install()` to install the new version of the package.\n4. Run `devtools::test()` to run the test scripts on the new version of the package.\n\nIf you are also prepping the package as a whole, then you will also want to run `devtools::check()` and/or `devtools::check_cran()` to make sure that the package is complete.\nNote that you need an up-to-date TeX/LaTeX distribution for running `devtools::check()` and/or `devtools::check_cran()` due to the rendering of the package manual.\n\nFor more info, see the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) for the `devtools` package. \n\n## Testing\n\nIf you are adding new functionality, please include automated tests to verify that some of the basic functionality is correct.\n\nAutomated testing uses R scripts, that live in the `tests/testthat/` subfolder for the package. If you are adding a new file, please name it as `test-{concept}.R`. \n\nAs a general rule, you don't need to test all possible inputs and outputs for a function, but you should test some important aspects:\n* outputs are the correct format (including dimensions and components)\n* sample input produces the correct sample output\n\nYou can see the existing tests as examples of how to organize your tests, but note that there are several different kinds of `expect_` functions that test for different things. For more details, see the [chapter on testing ](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html) in Hadley Wickham's book for R packages.\n\n## Attribution \n\nThis document is based on the [CONTRIBUTING \nfile](https://github.com/weecology/portalr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nassociated with the Beta release of the \n[**portalr**](https://github.com/weecology/portalr/) package\nand is used under the MIT License.\n"

As a result, much of the documentation code isn't run and therefore would not break builds if it would error. \r\n* To address this, we add two scripts in the new inst/extra_testing folder and a github action runner for each.\r\n\r\n## Added CITATION file\r\n* Cites the JOSS paper.\r\n\r\n## Bringing the app code into the package\r\n* Improves robustness of building the app (includes code and dependencies in the docker image, allows for unit testing app components, etc.)\r\n* Also allows users to spin-up a local version with `run_web_app()` pointed to `main`\r\n\r\n## Using `arrow` to speed up reading and writing files\r\n\r\n## Evaluation figures now read from evaluations file\r\n* Avoids computing evaluations while generating plots\r\n\r\n## Elimination of model-named functions\r\n* The models are now implemented using `cast` on their fit and cast elements in their control lists\r\n* Only models the need new functions have them (`meta_tsglm` and `fit_runjags`) for fitting\r\n* `forecast` method used generally now for `cast` function\r\n  * introduction of `forecast` methods for `tsglm` and `runjags` objects\r\n\r\n## Shifting covariates to a daily-level build initial step\r\n* need to shift this to level daily so we can manage when a newmoon is split between historic and forecast days\r\n\r\n## Putting species under dataset in the models' controls lists\r\n* This is more articulated and allows for finer control to help avoid fitting issues, etc.\r\n\r\n## Moving arguments into functionalities\r\n* `cast_date` is not an argument anymore, just filled automatically \r\n* `dataset` arguments are also being removed as possible to streamline (just pull from model controls)\r\n\r\n## Model functions are now species-level\r\n* To facilitate a lot of downstream functionality, we're breaking up the model functions to operate on the species-level rather than the dataset-level, according to the new control lists\r\n* Species that were failing the nb GARCH models (s or not) have been removed, since that throws a warning and then fits a Poisson version, and we are now fitting Poisson versions of everyone.\r\n\r\n## process_model_output replaces save_cast_output and various model processing bits\r\n* provides a much more general way to produce a forecast that can be integrated in the system, leveraging the metadata files\r\n\r\n## casts metadata table includes new column\r\n* species\r\n* to facilitate backwards compatibility, filled with NA for previous tables if missing when loaded\r\n\r\n## updates to prefab models to 13 time steps forward (addressing issue 297)\r\n* pevGARCH, nbGARCH, nbsGARCH all get past_mean set to 13 \r\n* all models set with lead_time of 13\r\n\r\n## new models\r\n* sAutoArima\r\n* sNaiveArima\r\n* pGARCH\r\n* psGARCH\r\n\r\n## new functions\r\n* `update_dir` is an \"update-flavored\" setup function \r\n\r\n## scoring\r\n* log and crps!\r\n",
