With this tool, you can report linear and\nlogistic regression coefficients accurately and instantly. The output of\nthe functions here is only readings in natural language and helps to\nstandardize the phrasing of widely used models. The package offers\nresults not only in English, but in multiple languages, and can\nautomatically control for heteroscedasticity, and offers the capability to\nchoose the type of standard error for the correction and group errors by\ncluster\u2014all in a single function. \n`Coefeasy` is a straightforward package designed primarily for, but not\nlimited to, people learning or teaching introduction to statistics or\neconometrics. Historically, although an interpretation of coefficients\nshould follow a consistent design, the underlying knowledge to read the\nresults of a regression can be quite technical and unambiguous in its\npresentation. Acknowledging this challenge, `coefeasy` offers a\nsystematic solution, primarily serving linear and logistic models. As\nevidence-based decision making continues to gain importance, `coefeasy`\naims to help close that knowledge gap, providing clear and accessible\nstatistical learning, and reinforcing the importance of automation and\nstandardization.\n \n"
