The symbolic analysis and ordering phase pre-eliminates singletons by permuting the input matrix A into the form [R11 R12; 0 A22] where R11 is upper triangular with diagonal entries above a given tolerance. Next, the fill-reducing ordering, column elimination tree, and frontal matrix structures are found without requiring the formation of the pattern of ATA. Approximate rank-detection is performed within each frontal matrix using Heath's method. While Heath's method is not always exact, it has the advantage of not requiring column pivoting and thus does not interfere with the fill-reducing ordering.

As the major component of a sparse direct solver, it represents the dominant computational cost for many analyses. For factorizations which involve sufficient dense math, the substantial computational capability provided by GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) can help alleviate this cost. However, for many other cases, the prevalence of small/irregular dense math and the relatively slow communication between the host and device over the PCIe bus, make it challenging to significantly accelerate sparse factorization using the GPU. In this paper we describe a left-looking supernodal Cholesky factorization algorithm which permits improved utilization of the GPU when factoring sparse matrices. The central idea is to stream subtrees of the elimination tree through the GPU and perform the factorization of each subtree entirely on the GPU. This avoids the majority of the PCIe communication without the need for a complex task scheduler. Importantly, within these subtrees, many independent, small, dense operations are batched to minimize kernel launch overhead and many of these batched kernels are executed concurrently to maximize device utilization. Performance results for commonly studied matrices are presented along with suggested actions for further optimization.}\n}\n\n@article{10.1145/1024074.1024081,\nauthor = {Amestoy, Patrick R. and Davis, Timothy A. and Duff, Iain S.},\ntitle = {Algorithm 837: AMD, an Approximate Minimum Degree Ordering Algorithm},\nyear = {2004},\nissue_date = {September 2004},\npublisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\naddress = {New York, NY, USA},\nvolume = {30},\nnumber = {3},\nissn = {0098-3500},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1145/1024074.1024081},\ndoi = {10.1145/1024074.1024081},\nabstract = {AMD is a set of routines that implements the approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm to permute sparse matrices prior to numerical factorization.

The fill-in also depends on P, but Q is selected to reduce an upper bound on the fill-in for any subsequent choice of P. The choice of Q can have a dramatic impact on the number of nonzeros in L and U. One scheme for determining a good column ordering for A is to compute a symmetric ordering that reduces fill-in in the Cholesky factorization of ATA. A conventional minimum degree ordering algorithm would require the sparsity structure of ATA to be computed, which can be expensive both in terms of space and time since ATA may be much denser than A. An alternative is to compute Q directly from the sparsity structure of A; this strategy is used by MATLAB's COLMMD preordering algorithm. A new ordering algorithm, COLAMD, is presented. It is based on the same strategy but uses a better ordering heuristic. COLAMD is faster and computes better orderings, with fewer nonzeros in the factors of the matrix.},\njournal = {ACM Trans. Math.

In the multifrontal method, work on a frontal matrix can be suspended, the frontal matrix can be stored for later reuse, and a new frontal matrix can be generated. There are thus several frontal matrices stored during the factorization, and one or more of these are assembled (summed) when creating a new frontal matrix. Although this means that arbitrary sparsity patterns can be handled efficiently, extra work is required to sum the frontal matrices together and can be costly because indirect addressing is requred. The (uni)frontal method avoids this extra work by factorizing the matrix with a single frontal matrix. Rows and columns are added  to the frontal matrix, and pivot rows and columns are removed. Data movement is simpler, but higher fill-in can result if the matrix cannot be permuted into a variable-band form with small profile. We consider a combined unifrontal/multifrontal algorithm to enable general fill-in reduction orderings to be applied without the data movement of previous multifrontal approaches.

For symmetric problems, methods such as the multifrontal method avoid indirect addressing in the innermost loops by using dense matrix kernels. However, no efficient LU factorization algorithm based primarily on dense matrix kernels exists for matrices whose pattern is very unsymmetric. We address this deficiency and present a new unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method based on dense matrix kernels. As in the classical multifrontal method, advantage is taken of repetitive structure in the matrix by factorizing more than one pivot in each frontal matrix, thus enabling the use of Level 2 and Level 3 BLAS. The performance is compared with the classical multifrontal method and other unsymmetric solvers on a CRAY C-98. }\n}\n\n\n@article{10.1145/2491491.2491498,\nauthor = {Davis, Timothy A.},\ntitle = {Algorithm 930: FACTORIZE: An Object-Oriented Linear System Solver for MATLAB},\nyear = {2013},\nissue_date = {July 2013},\npublisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\naddress = {New York, NY, USA},\nvolume = {39},\nnumber = {4},\nissn = {0098-3500},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1145/2491491.2491498},\ndoi = {10.1145/2491491.2491498},\nabstract = {The MATLAB\u2122 backslash (x=Ab) is an elegant and powerful interface to a suite of high-performance factorization methods for the direct solution of the linear system Ax = b and the least-squares problem minx \u2016b - Ax\u2016. It is a meta-algorithm that selects the best factorization method for a particular matrix, whether sparse or dense. However, the simplicity and elegance of its single-character interface prohibits the reuse of its factorization for subsequent systems. Requiring MATLAB users to find the best factorization method on their own can lead to suboptimal choices; even MATLAB experts can make the wrong choice. Furthermore, naive MATLAB users have a tendency to translate mathematical expressions from linear algebra directly into MATLAB, so that x = A-1b becomes the inferior yet all-to-prevalent x=inv(A)*b. To address these issues, an object-oriented FACTORIZE method is presented. Via simple-to-use operator overloading, solving two linear systems can be written as F=factorize(A); x=Fb; y=Fc, where A is factorized only once. The selection of the best factorization method (LU, Cholesky, LDLT, QR, or a complete orthogonal decomposition for rank-deficient matrices) is hidden from the user. The mathematical expression x = A-1b directly translates into the MATLAB expression x=inverse(A)*b, which does not compute the inverse at all, but does the right thing by factorizing A and solving the corresponding triangular systems.},\njournal = {ACM Trans.

In general, these settings\n  are not strict.  For example, if `SUITESPARSE_USE_OPENMP` is `ON` then OpenMP\n  is preferred, but SuiteSparse can be used without OpenMP so no error is\n  generated if OpenMP is not found.  However, if `SUITESPARSE_USE_STRICT` is\n  `ON` then all `*_USE_*` settings are treated strictly and an error occurs\n  if any are set to `ON` but the corresponding package or setting is not\n  available.  The `*_USE_SYSTEM_*` settings are always treated as strict.\n  Default: `OFF`. \n  If set to `ON`, CUDA is enabled for all of SuiteSparse.  Default: `ON`, \n  Postfix for installation target of header from SuiteSparse. Default:\n  suitesparse, so the default include directory is:\n  `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/include/suitesparse` \n  If `ON`, static libraries are built.\n  Default: `ON`, except for GraphBLAS, which takes a long time to compile so\n  the default for GraphBLAS is `OFF` unless `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` is `OFF`. \n  GraphBLAS, LAGraph, and ParU will be vastly slower if OpenMP is not used.\n  CHOLMOD will be somewhat slower without OpenMP (as long as it still has a\n  parallel BLAS/LAPACK).  Three packages (UMFPACK, CHOLMOD, and SPQR) rely\n  heavily on parallel BLAS/LAPACK libraries and those libraries may use OpenMP\n  internally.  If you wish to disable OpenMP in an entire application, select a\n  single-threaded BLAS/LAPACK, or a parallel BLAS/LAPACK that does not use\n  OpenMP (such as the Apple Accelerate Framework).  Using a single-threaded\n  BLAS/LAPACK library will cause UMFPACK, CHOLMOD, and SPQR to be vastly\n  slower. \n  If `ON`, `SuiteSparse_config` uses OpenMP if it is available.\n  Default: `SUITESPARSE_USE_OPENMP`.\n  It is not essential and only used to let `SuiteSparse_time` call\n  `omp_get_wtime`. \n  If `ON`, use the Fortran compiler to determine how C calls Fortan, and to\n  build several optional Fortran routines. If `OFF`, use\n  `SUITESPARSE_C_TO_FORTRAN` to define how C calls Fortran.\n  WARNING: mixing C/C++/Fortran compilers from different places is not\n  recommended.  Using the Intel C compiler (icx), GNU Fortran (gfortran or\n  f95), and the Intel MKL BLAS together will result in two OpenMP libraries\n  being linked (Intel's libiomp and the GNU libgomp).  This is a recipe for\n  disaster, and the cmake scripts check this and report fatal error if it's\n  attempted.  Other cases lead to a cmake warning.  If you get the warning,\n  check your built libraries and ensure that only one OpenMP library is in\n  use (GNU: libgomp, Intel: libiomp, Clang: libomp).  If you see this case,\n  use compatible compilers, or switch Fortran off.\n  Default: `ON`. \nCHOLMOD is composed of a set of Modules that can be independently selected;\nall options default to `ON`: \n  If `OFF`, do not link against CAMD and CCOLAMD.

        "value": "Type the following in this directory (requires system priviledge to do the\n`sudo make install`):\n```\n    mkdir -p build && cd build\n    cmake ..\n    cmake --build .\n    sudo cmake --install .\n```\n\nAll libraries will be created and installed into the default system-wide folder\n(/usr/local/lib on Linux).  All include files needed by the applications that\nuse SuiteSparse are installed into /usr/local/include/suitesparse (on Linux).\n\nTo build only a subset of libraries, set `SUITESPARSE_ENABLE_PROJECTS` when\nconfiguring with CMake.  E.g., to build and install CHOLMOD and CXSparse\n(including their dependencies), use the following commands:\n```\n    mkdir -p build && cd build\n    cmake -DSUITESPARSE_ENABLE_PROJECTS=\"cholmod;cxsparse\" ..\n    cmake --build .\n    sudo cmake --install .\n```\n\nFor Windows (MSVC), import the `CMakeLists.txt` file into MS Visual Studio.\nBe sure to specify the build type as Release; for example, to build SuiteSparse\non Windows in the command window, run:\n```\n    mkdir -p build && cd build\n    cmake ..\n    cmake --build . --config Release\n    cmake --install .\n```\n\nBe sure to first install all required libraries:  BLAS and LAPACK for UMFPACK,\nCHOLMOD, and SPQR, and GMP and MPFR for SPEX.  Be sure to use the latest\nlibraries; SPEX requires MPFR 4.0.2 and GMP 6.1.2 (these version numbers\ndo NOT correspond to the X.Y.Z suffix of libgmp.so.X.Y.Z and libmpfr.so.X.Y.Z;\nsee the SPEX user guide for details).\n\nTo compile the libraries and install them only in SuiteSparse/lib (not\n/usr/local/lib), do this instead in the top-level of SuiteSparse:\n```\n    mkdir -p build && cd build\n    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.. ..\n    cmake --build .\n    cmake --install .\n```\n\nIf you add /home/me/SuiteSparse/lib to your library search path\n(`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in Linux), you can do the following (for example):\n```\n    S = /home/me/SuiteSparse\n    cc myprogram.c -I$(S)/include/suitesparse -lumfpack -lamd -lcholmod -lsuitesparseconfig -lm\n```\n\nTo change the C and C++ compilers, and to compile in parallel use:\n```\n    cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER==g++ ..\n```\n\nfor example, which changes the compiler to gcc and g++.\n\nThis will work on Linux/Unix and the Mac.  It should automatically detect if\nyou have the Intel compilers or not, and whether or not you have CUDA.\n\nSee `SuiteSparse_config/cmake_modules/SuiteSparsePolicy.cmake` to select your BLAS.\n\nYou may also need to add SuiteSparse/lib to your path.  If your copy of\nSuiteSparse is in /home/me/SuiteSparse, for example, then add this to your\n`~/.bashrc` file:\n\n```\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/me/SuiteSparse/lib\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n```\n\nFor the Mac, use this instead:\n```\nDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/me/SuiteSparse/lib\nexport DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\n```\n\nDefault install location of files is below, where PACKAGE is one of the\npackages in SuiteSparse:\n\n    * `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/include/suitesparse/`: include files\n    * `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/`: compiled libraries\n    * `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/cmake/SuiteSparse/`: `*.cmake` scripts\n        for all of SuiteSparse\n    * `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/cmake/PACKAGE/`: `*Config.cmake` scripts for a\n        specific package\n    * `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig/PACKAGE.pc`: `.pc` scripts for\n        a specific package pkgconfig\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

In the system shell while in the\nSuiteSparse folder, type `make gbmatlab` if you want to install it system-wide\nwith `make install`, or `make gblocal` if you want to use the library in\nyour own SuiteSparse/lib.\n\nThen in the MATLAB Command Window, cd to the SuiteSparse directory and type\n`SuiteSparse_install`.  All packages will be compiled, and several demos will be\nrun.  To run a (long!) exhaustive test, do `SuiteSparse_test`.\n\nSave your MATLAB path for future sessions with the MATLAB pathtool or savepath\ncommands.  If those methods fail because you don't have system-wide permission,\nadd the new paths to your startup.m file, normally in\nDocuments/MATLAB/startup.m.  You can also use the `SuiteSparse_paths` m-file to\nset all your paths at the start of each MATLAB session.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------"
