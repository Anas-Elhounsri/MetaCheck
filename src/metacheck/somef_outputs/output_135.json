In these rows, columns 2 and 3 are parallel mappings of values, meaning that the barcode numbers in column 2 should be matched to the corresponding values in the semicolon-separated list of the 3rd column.  The other column values apply to each of the individual values in the compound.\n\n_Split It!_ is a simple program that takes such as spreadsheet, splits the compound rows into separate rows, and produces a new spreadsheet with the collected results.

On all systems, the installation _should_ place a new program on your shell's search path called `splitit` (or `splitit.exe` on Windows), so that you can start _Split It!_ with a simple terminal command:\n```csh\nsplitit\n```\n\n_Split It!_ accepts various command-line arguments.  To get information about the available options, use the `-h` argument (or `/h` on Windows):\n```csh\nsplitit -h\n```\n\nIn normal operation, _Split It!_ does not need to be started with any options; it will use GUI file dialogs to prompt for a file to open as input and a destination where to write the output.  Alternatively, these files can be provided on the command line via two options: an `-i` option (`/i` on Windows) to indicate the input CSV file, and an `-o` option (`/o` on Windows) to indicate the file where it should write the output in CSV format.  Here's an example to illustrate this:\n```csh\nsplitit -i input.csv -o output.csv\n```\n\nIf one or the other are not supplied, _Split It!_ will resort to using GUI file dialogs, unless the option `-G` (`/G` on Windows) is used to indicate that no GUI should be used.\n\n"
