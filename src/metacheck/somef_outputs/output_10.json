The symbolic analysis and ordering phase pre-eliminates singletons by permuting the input matrix A into the form [R11 R12; 0 A22] where R11 is upper triangular with diagonal entries above a given tolerance. Next, the fill-reducing ordering, column elimination tree, and frontal matrix structures are found without requiring the formation of the pattern of ATA.

As the major component of a sparse direct solver, it represents the dominant computational cost for many analyses. For factorizations which involve sufficient dense math, the substantial computational capability provided by GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) can help alleviate this cost. However, for many other cases, the prevalence of small/irregular dense math and the relatively slow communication between the host and device over the PCIe bus, make it challenging to significantly accelerate sparse factorization using the GPU. In this paper we describe a left-looking supernodal Cholesky factorization algorithm which permits improved utilization of the GPU when factoring sparse matrices. The central idea is to stream subtrees of the elimination tree through the GPU and perform the factorization of each subtree entirely on the GPU. This avoids the majority of the PCIe communication without the need for a complex task scheduler. Importantly, within these subtrees, many independent, small, dense operations are batched to minimize kernel launch overhead and many of these batched kernels are executed concurrently to maximize device utilization.

The fill-in also depends on P, but Q is selected to reduce an upper bound on the fill-in for any subsequent choice of P. The choice of Q can have a dramatic impact on the number of nonzeros in L and U. One scheme for determining a good column ordering for A is to compute a symmetric ordering that reduces fill-in in the Cholesky factorization of ATA. A conventional minimum degree ordering algorithm would require the sparsity structure of ATA to be computed, which can be expensive both in terms of space and time since ATA may be much denser than A. An alternative is to compute Q directly from the sparsity structure of A; this strategy is used by MATLAB's COLMMD preordering algorithm. A new ordering algorithm, COLAMD, is presented.

Although this means that arbitrary sparsity patterns can be handled efficiently, extra work is required to sum the frontal matrices together and can be costly because indirect addressing is requred. The (uni)frontal method avoids this extra work by factorizing the matrix with a single frontal matrix. Rows and columns are added  to the frontal matrix, and pivot rows and columns are removed. Data movement is simpler, but higher fill-in can result if the matrix cannot be permuted into a variable-band form with small profile.

For symmetric problems, methods such as the multifrontal method avoid indirect addressing in the innermost loops by using dense matrix kernels. However, no efficient LU factorization algorithm based primarily on dense matrix kernels exists for matrices whose pattern is very unsymmetric. We address this deficiency and present a new unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method based on dense matrix kernels. As in the classical multifrontal method, advantage is taken of repetitive structure in the matrix by factorizing more than one pivot in each frontal matrix, thus enabling the use of Level 2 and Level 3 BLAS. The performance is compared with the classical multifrontal method and other unsymmetric solvers on a CRAY C-98. }\n}\n\n\n@article{10.1145/2491491.2491498,\nauthor = {Davis, Timothy A.},\ntitle = {Algorithm 930: FACTORIZE: An Object-Oriented Linear System Solver for MATLAB},\nyear = {2013},\nissue_date = {July 2013},\npublisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\naddress = {New York, NY, USA},\nvolume = {39},\nnumber = {4},\nissn = {0098-3500},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1145/2491491.2491498},\ndoi = {10.1145/2491491.2491498},\nabstract = {The MATLAB\u2122 backslash (x=Ab) is an elegant and powerful interface to a suite of high-performance factorization methods for the direct solution of the linear system Ax = b and the least-squares problem minx \u2016b - Ax\u2016. It is a meta-algorithm that selects the best factorization method for a particular matrix, whether sparse or dense. However, the simplicity and elegance of its single-character interface prohibits the reuse of its factorization for subsequent systems. Requiring MATLAB users to find the best factorization method on their own can lead to suboptimal choices; even MATLAB experts can make the wrong choice. Furthermore, naive MATLAB users have a tendency to translate mathematical expressions from linear algebra directly into MATLAB, so that x = A-1b becomes the inferior yet all-to-prevalent x=inv(A)*b. To address these issues, an object-oriented FACTORIZE method is presented. Via simple-to-use operator overloading, solving two linear systems can be written as F=factorize(A); x=Fb; y=Fc, where A is factorized only once. The selection of the best factorization method (LU, Cholesky, LDLT, QR, or a complete orthogonal decomposition for rank-deficient matrices) is hidden from the user. The mathematical expression x = A-1b directly translates into the MATLAB expression x=inverse(A)*b, which does not compute the inverse at all, but does the right thing by factorizing A and solving the corresponding triangular systems.},\njournal = {ACM Trans.

SPEX Left LU preorders the matrix A with a user-specified fill-reducing ordering and computes a left-looking LU factorization with the special property that each operation used to compute the L and U matrices is integral. Notable additional applications of this package include benchmarking the stability and accuracy of state-of-the-art linear solvers, and determining whether singular-to-double-precision matrices are indeed singular. Computationally, this paper evaluates the impact of several novel pivoting schemes in exact arithmetic, benchmarks the exact iterative solvers within Linbox, and benchmarks the accuracy of MATLAB sparse backslash. Most importantly, it is shown that SPEX Left LU outperforms the exact iterative solvers in run time on easy instances and in stability as the iterative solver fails on a sizeable subset of the tested (both easy and hard) instances.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

In\nparticular, the implementation did not provide relocatable CMake package\nconfiguration and awkwardly relied on Python for preprocessing source files (as\nof August 2021, it still does.)\n\nFor IP (and legal) reasons, the provided CMake additions cannot become part of\nofficial SuiteSparse releases.
