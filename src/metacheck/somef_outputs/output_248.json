The Caltech Library uses a hosted solution by [EBSCO](https://www.ebsco.com) for its [library catalog](https://www.library.caltech.edu/libsearch).   To make writing interfaces and automation scripts in Python easier, the Caltech Library [Digital Library Development team](https://www.library.caltech.edu/staff?&field_directory_department%5B0%5D=754) are developing Pokapi (_Python Okapi Interface_), a Python package that provides an object-oriented interface to accessing FOLIO data via the [Okapi API](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md).

This is often the easiest approach to getting Python on your machine.  If that's not suitable for you for any reason, continue reading!\n\n\n## A note about Python version issues\n\nIt may be possible to use the default copy of Python provided by your operating system if it happens to be a version 3 edition of Python.  As of January 2021, the [oldest still-supported version of Python is 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  However, for historical reasons, many operating system distributions still ship with Python version 2.7 even today. This can be confusing, because the default `python` and `pip` commands provided on these operating systems is version 2.7 of Python; attempting to run programs written for Python version 3 with version 2.7 can result in extremely confusing errors that bear no relationship to the _actual_ problem, which is that the program is not written to run in Python 2.7.\n\n\n## Installing a recent version of Python and `pip`\n\nOn some systems, version 3.x of the Python interpreter and `pip` are available using the commands `python3` and `pip3`, respectively. More often, they must be installed separately.  The following subsections describe how Python 3 can be installed either using the standard software package managers on certain popular operating systems, or using third-party software managers.\n\n\n### Debian/Ubuntu\n\nDebian-based systems still ship with older versions of Python by\ndefault. To install a modern version of Python and the associated version of `pip`, run the following command:\n\n```\nsudo apt install python3 python3-pip\n```\n\n### macOS\n\nThe version of Python that comes with macOS through at least macOS 10.15 (Catalina) is Python 2.7.  The most convenient way to get Python 3.x and the associated version of `pip` is to use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) or [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), depending on your preference.\n\n\n#### _Using MacPorts_\n\nIf you are using macOS and MacPorts, the following command will install a recent version of Python 3:\n\n```\nsudo port install python3 py38-pip\n```\n\nAfter running the command above, you should be able to invoke the Python interpreter using the command `python3`. You can verify the version of Python and `pip` with the following commands:\n\n```\npython3 --version\npython3 -m pip --version\n```\n\n#### _Using HomeBrew_\n\nIf you are using [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), the corresponding commands are as follows:\n\n```\nbrew install python3\n```\n\nHomeBrew's Python 3 package installs `pip3` by default.  Unless you configured your copy of HomeBrew to install it elsewhere, programs should end up in `/usr/local/bin` on your computer.  Look for `pip3` there (e.g., by running the command `ls /usr/local/bin/pip*` to see what gets listed).\n"

        "value": "To use Pokapi, first create a `Folio` object with parameters that define certain things Pokapi can't get on its own. These are: the the Okapi URL for your instance, an Okapi API token, a tenant id, and the prefix that appears in front of your accession numbers.  Assuming that these values are stored in separate variables, the following code illustrates how to create a `Folio` object:\n```python\nfrom pokapi import Folio\n\nfolio = Folio(okapi_url = the_okapi_url,\n              okapi_token = the_okapi_token,\n              tenant_id = the_tenant_id,\n              an_prefix = the_accession_number_prefix)\n```\n\nAs an example of a prefix for accession numbers, for Caltech the prefix is the `clc` part of an accession number such as `clc.025d49d5.735a.4d79.8889.c5895ac65fd2`. \n\n"

This method contacts the FOLIO server to obtain data and returns a `FolioRecord` object with the data stored in fields.
