After all, nothing is truly done in isolation; everything is built on top of something, and we all owe debts to other projects and people who helped us, supported us, and influenced us.\n\nFor example, in the process of developing this file, I used not only my own ideas: I read many (sometimes contradictory) recommendations for README files, examined real READMEs in actual use, and tried to distill the best ideas into the result you see here.

Its structure is based on many other people's examples and recommendations for README files, as well as the author's own experiences of creating open-source projects and repositories over three decades. It is written in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) format, but could easily be converted to other formats.\n\nFor a real software project, the [Introduction](#introduction) section \u2013 which you are presently reading \u2013 should summarize the motivations for creating the software, the need(s) addressed by the software, what the software does, and optionally, links to resources that can help orient readers. Ideally, this section should be short and use plain language. Keep in mind that not all readers will be familiar with the topic area.\n\n"

If your software can be installed using common installers or package managers (e.g., `pip`, `npm`, `brew`, `apt`, etc.), illustrate how it can be done using [code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) in the Markdown file so that it's clear to readers. For example,\n\n```sh\npip install yoursoftware\n```\n\nFor installation methods that don't involve command lines, providing screenshots along with written instructions can help readers figure out what they need to do.\n\nSubsections may be appropriate within this [Installation](#installation) section for different operating systems or particularly complicated installations.

This repetition is unavoidable, but also, not entirely undesirable: the more detailed explanations in this [Usage](#usage) section can help provide more context as well as clarify possible ambiguities that may exist in the more concise [Quick start](#quick-start) section.\n\nIf your software is complex and has many features, it may be better to create a dedicated website for your documentation (e.g., in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com), or similar) rather than to cram everything into a single linear README file.

If your software has a help system of some kind (e.g., in the form of a command-line flag such as `--help`, or a menu item in a GUI), explaining it is an excellent starting point for this section.\n\nThe basic approach for using this README file is as follows:\n\n1. Copy the [README source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhucka/readmine/main/README.md) to your repository\n2. Delete the body text but keep the section headings\n3. Replace the title heading (the first line of the file) with the name of your software\n4. Save the resulting skeleton file in your version control system\n5. Continue by writing your real README content in the file\n\nThe first paragraph in the README file (under the title at the top) should summarize your software in a concise fashion, preferably using no more than one or two sentences as illustrated by the circled text in the figure below.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img alt=\"Screenshot showing the top portion of this file on the web.\" width=\"80%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhucka/readmine/main/.graphics/screenshot-top-paragraph.png\"><br>\n<em>Figure: Screenshot showing elements of the top portion of this file.</em>\n</p>\n\nThe space under the first paragraph and _before_ the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) is a good location for optional [badges](https://github.com/badges/shields), which are small visual tokens commonly used on GitHub repositories to communicate project status, dependencies, versions, DOIs, and other information.
