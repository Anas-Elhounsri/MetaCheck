It contacts an EPrints server, obtains the list of documents it serves (optionally filtered based on such things as modification date), determines the document URLs, extracts additional URLs by scraping pages under the `/view` section of the public site, and finally, sends the collected URLs to web archives.  Use-cases include archiving an server content ahead of migration to another system, and preserving contents in independent third-party archives.\n\nThe program is written in Python 3 and works over a network using an EPrints server's REST API and normal HTTP.  `eprints2archives` can work with EPrints servers that require logins as well as those that allow anonymous access.  It uses parallel threads by default, transparently handles rate limits, and robustly deals with network errors.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://asciinema.org/a/357432\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/eprints2archives/main/.graphics/eprints2archives-1.2-screenshot.png\" alt=\"Screencast of simple eprints2archives\"><i>Click to run asciinema screencast.</i></a>\n</p>\n\n"

The latter offers the option of capturing pages more deeply if the user is logged in to their Internet Archive (IA) account.  By contrast, `eprints2archives` can send the entire content of an EPrints server in one go, without requiring the user to have an IA account. \nMany institutions use IA's [Archive-It](https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360004651612-Archive-It-Information) service, and Archive-It can be used to crawl EPrints server pages.  In principle, this can capture an EPrints server site more fully than `eprints2archives` because `eprints2archives` only follows specific common links and pages, and misses any custom data views or additional pages (including \"About\" pages) that may be present on an EPrints server.  Nevertheless, `eprints2archives` can be useful even for sites that use Archive-It because it asks the EPrints server itself about its records and gets URLs (such as the `official_url` values) that may not be mentioned in the EPrints record views (and thus would be missed by Archive-It's \"on the outside looking in\" approach).  Since `eprints2archives` by default does not send URLs that are already present in archiving destinations, it can be used in conjunction with Archive-It as a secondary or backup scheme. \nA number of third-party archiving tools exist for sending URLs to web archives.  One of the few that can target other archives besides IA is [Archive Now](https://github.com/oduwsdl/archivenow).  It partly inspired the creation of `eprints2archives`.  Archive Now's code for interfacing to web archives also served as initial starting points for figuring out to do the same in `eprints2archives`.  In terms of functionality, `eprints2archives` is more special-purpose (being aimed at extracting content from EPrints servers), and has more advanced capabilities such as handling rate limits, pause-and-retry handling of errors, and use of parallel threads. \nMost archiving tools work only with the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/). The Ruby-based [WaybackArchiver](https://github.com/buren/wayback_archiver) can crawl a site given a URL or a sitemap and then send URLs to IA; however, it does not appear to attempt to recover from as many error situations as `eprints2archives`, and of course, lacks its EPrints-specific features.  [Waybackpy](https://github.com/akamhy/waybackpy) is a simpler tool designed to interact with IA, and while it can submit URLs to be saved, it lacks other capabilities of `eprints2archives` such as automatically handling rate limits and error retries, as well as not being designed for extracting content from EPrints servers.  Some other similar but much simpler and less advanced IA-specific tools include [savepagenow](https://github.com/pastpages/savepagenow), [ia_wayback](https://github.com/bitsgalore/iawayback), [Wayback Sitemap Archive](https://github.com/plibither8/wayback-sitemap-archive), [Save to the Wayback Machine](https://github.com/VerifiedJoseph/Save-to-the-Wayback-Machine), and the [wayback api](https://github.com/httpreserve/wayback) from HTTPreserve. \n"

This was not done for over a year and it showed...\r\n* Add requirement for a certain package imported by another requirement but that does not, for some reason, get imported properly when a clean virtual environment is created in the process of making pyz apps.\r\n\r\n# New: self-contained binary distributions\r\n\r\nThis release includes standalone, runnable binaries for macOS and Linux.  These experimental binaries were built using [shiv](https://github.com/linkedin/shiv).  They only need a copy of Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 on your system to run &ndash; they **don't require installation of additional Python packages** using (e.g.) `pip`.  They should work on macOS 10.13&ndash;11.1, Ubuntu 18+, CentOS 7.5, and probably others.  To use them:\r\n\r\n1. Download the zip file for either the Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 or the 3.9 version, depending on the version of Python you have installed on your computer. (Use `python3 --version` to find out the version you have.)\r\n\r\n2. Unzip the resulting file (if your web browser did not automatically unzip it).\r\n\r\n3. Move the file `eprints2archives` to a location where your terminal shell looks for programs.  A popular location is `/usr/local/bin`.\r\n\r\nThereafter, you should be able to type `eprints2archives` in your shell and it should run.  (If it does not, please report the problem using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/eprints2archives/issues).)  Note that the first time you run it, `eprints2archives` will take longer than usual to start because it does a one-time configuration step, but on subsequent runs, startup times should be shorter.\r\n",

Download the zip file for either the Python 3.7, 3.8 or the 3.9 version, depending on the version of Python you have installed on your computer\r\n\r\n2. Unzip the resulting file (if your web browser did not automatically unzip it)\r\n\r\n3. Move the file `eprints2archives` to a location where your terminal shell looks for programs.  A popular location is `/usr/local/bin`.\r\n\r\nThereafter, you should be able to type `eprints2archives` in your shell and it should run.  (If it does not, please report the problem using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/eprints2archives/issues).)  Note that the first time you run it, `eprints2archives` will take longer than usual to start because it does a one-time configuration step, but on subsequent runs, startup times should be shorter.\r\n",

However, if a subset of records is requested, only gets those particular `/view/X/N.html` pages rather than all pages under `/view/X/`.\r\n* Internal changes allow it to use protocol HTTP/2, which was necessary to communicate with Archive.Today (because it appears to have stopped accepting save requests unless HTTP2 is used).\r\n* Now tries to add `https://` or `http://` if the user forgets to provide it, and also removes `/eprint` and adds `/rest` if needed.  This makes it possible for the user to just provide a host name and `eprints2archives` will figure out the rest.\r\n* Minor improvements to some of the run-time status messages.\r\n* More progress bars!\r\n* Improvements to debug logging.\r\n* Improvements to README.md.\r\n* Internal code refactoring.\r\n",

The value of `-i` can be one or more integers separated by commas (e.g., `-i 54602,54604`), or a range of numbers separated by a dash (e.g., `-i 1-100`, which is interpreted as the list of numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 inclusive), or some combination thereof. The value of the option `-i` can also be a file, in which case, the file is read to get a list of identifiers.\n\nIf the `-l` option (or `/l` on Windows) is given, the records will be additionally filtered to return only those whose last-modified date/time stamp is no older than the given date/time description.  Valid descriptors are those accepted by the Python [dateparser](https://pypi.org/project/dateparser/) library.  Make sure to enclose descriptions within single or double quotes.  Examples:\n\n``` shell\neprints2archives -l \"2 weeks ago\" -a ....\neprints2archives -l \"2014-08-29\"  -a ....\neprints2archives -l \"12 Dec 2014\" -a ....\neprints2archives -l \"July 4, 2013\" -a ....\n```\n\nIf the `-s` option (or `/s` on Windows) is given, the records will also be filtered to include only those whose `eprint_status` field value is one of the listed status codes.  Comparisons are done in a case-insensitive manner.  Putting a caret character (`^`) in front of the status (or status list) negates the sense, so that `eprints2archives` will only keep those records whose `<eprint_status>` value is *not* among those given. Examples:\n\n``` shell\neprints2archives -s archive -a ...\neprints2archives -s ^inbox,buffer,deletion -a ...\n```\n\nBoth `--lastmod` and `--status` filtering are done after the `-i` argument is processed.\n\nBy default, if an error occurs when requesting a record or value from the EPrints server, `eprints2archives` will keep going, moving on to the next one. Common causes of errors include missing records implied by the arguments to `-i`, missing files associated with a given record, and files inaccessible due to permissions errors. If the option `-e` (or `/e` on Windows) is given, `eprints2archives` will instead stop upon encountering a missing record, or missing file within a record, or similar errors. The default is to only issue warnings because this is less frustrating for most use-cases.\n\n"

The value of the field `official_url` (if any) in the EPrint record.\n\nThe first two typically go to the same page on an EPrint server, but web archiving services have no direct mechanism to indicate that a given URL is an alias or redirection for another, so they need to be sent as separate URLs.  On the other hand, the value of `official_url` may be an entirely different URL, which may or may not go to the same location as one of the others.  For example, in the CaltechAUTHORS EPrint server, the record at [`https://authors.library.caltech.edu/85447`](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/85447) has an `official_url` value of [`https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20180327-085537493`](https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechAUTHORS:20180327-085537493), but the latter is a redirection back to [`https://authors.library.caltech.edu/85447`](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/85447).  `eprints2archives` performs basic validation on the URL values, to make sure they appear to be formally valid and filter out malformed URLs, but does not verify that the locations actually exist.\n\n"

To learn which services `eprints2archives` knows about, use the option `-S` (or `/S` on Windows). By default, the program will send EPrints record URLs to all the known services. The option `-d` (or `/d` on Windows) can be used to select one or a list of destination services instead.  Lists of services should be separated by commas with no spaces between them;\ne.g., `internetarchive,archivetoday`.\n\nBy default, `eprints2archives` will only ask a service to archive a copy of an EPrints record if the service does not already have an archived copy.  This makes sense because EPrints records usually change infrequently, and there's little point in repeatedly asking web archives to make new archives.  However, if you have reason to want the web archives to re-archive EPrints records, you can use the option `-f` (or `/f` on Windows).\n\n`eprints2archives` will use parallel process threads to query the EPrints server as well as to send records to archiving services.  By default, the maximum number of threads used is equal to 1/2 of the number of cores on the computer it is running on. The option `-t` (or `/t` on Windows) can be used to change this number.  `eprints2archives` will always use only one thread per web archiving service (and since there are only a few services, only a few threads are usable during that phase of operation), but a higher number of threads can be helpful to speed up the initial data gathering step from the EPrints server.\n\n**Beware that there is a lag** between when web archives such as Internet Archive receive a URL submission and when a saved copy is made available from the archive.  (For Internet Archive, it is [3-10 hours](https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360004651732-Using-The-Wayback-Machine).)  If you cannot find a given EPrints page in an archive shortly after running `eprints2archives`, it may be because not enough time has passed.\n\n"
