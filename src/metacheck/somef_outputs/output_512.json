        "value": "Ascochyta blight epidemics have been observed in many countries since the early 1900s but studies on an interaction between the amount of inoculum, environmental factors and the spatiotemporal development of Ascochyta blight are rare due to the historic emphasis on developing resistant cultivars and chemical control of the disease. I used generalised linear mixed models to investigate key environmental factors affecting the spatiotemporal development of Ascochyta blight from primary infection foci. Briefly, four replicate plots (20 m\u2009\u00d7\u200920 m) of a susceptible chickpea cultivar were planted at two different locations (Billa Billa and Tosari) in Queensland, Australia. Four naturally infested stubble pieces were placed at the centre of each newly emerged chickpea plot 14 days after sowing. The number of infected plants was counted in 1 m2 observation quadrats at the distances of 3, 6 and 9 m in a concentric arrangement. The number of infected plants increased with each assessment date, approaching 100% plant infections at the time of final assessment. The rate of disease progress was significantly faster at Tosari. The rate of disease progress significantly decreased as the distance from the primary infection foci increased. There was a significant positive effect of an optimum temperature, increasing rainfall and omni-directional wind. The influence of wind speed was not significant. The finding that single infection foci were enough to spread disease across whole plots indicate that limited inoculum is not a barrier in the development of an epiphytotic under conducive conditions. \n"
