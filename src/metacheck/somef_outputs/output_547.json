Then clone and install the library in development mode with\n\n```bash\npip install -e .\n```\n\n3. Install pre-commit and run it. Our pre-commit hooks consist in `ruff format` and `ruff check`. You can install `ruff` simply by `pip install ruff`. We highly recommend you to check the code type hints with `pyright` even though we currently have no rule concerning type checking in the pipeline.\n\n```bash\npip install pre-commit\npre-commit install\n```\n\n 4. Open a merge request once you are done with your changes, the review will be done via Gitlab.\n"

No reinventing the wheel: it relies on the JAX ecosystem whenever possible, such as [equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox/) for neural networks or [optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/) for optimization. \n- **jinns is highly modular** - It gives users maximum control for defining their problems, and extending the package. The maths and computations are visible and not hidden behind layers of code! \n- **jinns is efficient** - It compares favorably to other existing Python package for PINNs on the [PINNacle benchmarks](https://github.com/i207M/PINNacle/), as demonstrated in the table below. For more details on the benchmarks, checkout the [PINN multi-library benchmark](https://gitlab.com/mia_jinns/pinn-multi-library-benchmark) \n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
