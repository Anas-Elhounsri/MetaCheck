This is often the easiest approach to getting Python on your machine.  If that's not suitable for you for any reason, continue reading!\n\n\n## A note about Python version issues\n\nIt may be possible to use the default copy of Python provided by your operating system if it happens to be a version 3 edition of Python.  As of January 2021, the [oldest still-supported version of Python is 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  However, for historical reasons, many operating system distributions still ship with Python version 2.7 even today. This can be confusing, because the default `python` and `pip` commands provided on these operating systems is version 2.7 of Python; attempting to run programs written for Python version 3 with version 2.7 can result in extremely confusing errors that bear no relationship to the _actual_ problem, which is that the program is not written to run in Python 2.7.\n\n\n## Installing a recent version of Python and `pip`\n\nOn some systems, version 3.x of the Python interpreter and `pip` are available using the commands `python3` and `pip3`, respectively. More often, they must be installed separately.  The following subsections describe how Python 3 can be installed either using the standard software package managers on certain popular operating systems, or using third-party software managers.\n\n\n### Debian/Ubuntu\n\nDebian-based systems still ship with older versions of Python by\ndefault. To install a modern version of Python and the associated version of `pip`, run the following command:\n\n```python\nsudo apt install python3 python3-pip\n```\n\n### macOS\n\nThe version of Python that comes with macOS through at least macOS 10.15 (Catalina) is Python 2.7.  The most convenient way to get Python 3.x and the associated version of `pip` is to use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) or [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), depending on your preference.\n\n\n#### _Using MacPorts_\n\nIf you are using macOS and MacPorts, the following command will install a recent version of Python 3:\n\n```python\nsudo port install python3 py38-pip\n```\n\nAfter running the command above, you should be able to invoke the Python interpreter using the command `python3`. You can verify the version of Python and `pip` with the following commands:\n\n```python\npython3 --version\npython3 -m pip --version\n```\n\n#### _Using HomeBrew_\n\nIf you are using [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), the corresponding commands are as follows:\n\n```python\nbrew install python3\n```\n\nHomeBrew's Python 3 package installs `pip3` by default.  Unless you configured your copy of HomeBrew to install it elsewhere, programs should end up in `/usr/local/bin` on your computer.  Look for `pip3` there (e.g., by running the command `ls /usr/local/bin/pip*` to see what gets listed).\n"

Please choose the alternative that suits you.\n\n\n## Preliminary requirements\n\nFoliage is written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org) and makes use of some additional Python software libraries that are installed automatically during the [installation steps](#installation). It also assumes a macOS, Windows or Linux environment, and a working Internet connection.\n\n\n## Installation instructions\n\n### _Alternative 1: installing the ready-to-run version_\n\nFor the Caltech Library, we provide Foliage in a ready-to-run form for Windows and macOS computers. This is the easiest and preferred way of getting a copy of Foliage. Please contact the author for more information.\n\n\n### _Alternative 2: installing Foliage using `pipx`_\n\nYou can use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install Foliage. Pipx will install it into a separate Python environment that isolates the dependencies needed by Foliage from other Python programs on your system, and yet the resulting `foliage` command wil be executable from any shell &ndash; like any normal program on your computer. If you do not already have `pipx` on your system, it can be installed in a variety of easy ways and it is best to consult [Pipx's installation guide](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/) for instructions. Once you have pipx on your system, you can install Foliage with the following command:\n```sh\npipx install foliage\n```\n\nPipx can also let you run Foliage directly using `pipx run foliage`, although in that case, you must always prefix every `foliage` command with `pipx run`.  Consult the [documentation for `pipx run`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx#walkthrough-running-an-application-in-a-temporary-virtual-environment) for more information.\n\n\n### _Alternative 3: installing Foliage using `pip`_\n\nThe instructions below assume you have a Python 3 interpreter installed on your computer.  Note that the default on macOS at least through 10.14 (Mojave) is Python **2** &ndash; please first install Python version 3 and familiarize yourself with running Python programs on your system before proceeding further.\n\nYou should be able to install `foliage` with [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for Python&nbsp;3.  To install `foliage` from the [Python package repository (PyPI)](https://pypi.org), run the following command:\n```sh\npython3 -m pip install foliage\n```\n\nAs an alternative to getting it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org), you can use `pip` to install `foliage` directly from GitHub:\n```sh\npython3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/calitechlibrary/foliage.git\n```\n\n_If you already installed Foliage once before_, and want to update to the latest version, add `--upgrade` to the end of either command line above.\n\n\n### _Alternative 4: installing Foliage from sources_\n\nIf  you prefer to install Foliage directly from the source code, you can do that too. To get a copy of the files, you can clone the GitHub repository:\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/caltechlibrary/foliage\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can download the files as a ZIP archive using this link directly from your browser using this link: <https://github.com/caltechlibrary/foliage/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>\n\nNext, after getting a copy of the files,  run `setup.py` inside the code directory:\n```sh\ncd foliage\npython3 setup.py install\n```\n\n"

        "value": "# Using PyInstaller\n\nPyInstaller is a tool that bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. It can be used to produce self-contained, single-file executable applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux. I\u2019ve used it to create binaries for many applications used by library staff (e.g., _Hold It_, _Lost It_, _Handprint_, _Foliage_, many others). There are other methods of creating single-file executables, such as using `shiv` (which I also do); compared to `shiv`, PyInstaller has the advantage that the result is truly a standalone application and does not require the user to have a Python runtime environment installed on their computer (unlike the case with `shiv`) but a disadvantage that the resulting application takes a noticeable amount of time to start up every time the user runs it.\n\nWhat follows is an attempt at describing everything I know about using PyInstaller. I will use Foliage as the example because that application makes use of some newer and advanced PyInstaller features.\n\n\n## Preliminary notes\n\nI was unable to get this to work in Python 3.9.8 on Windows; I had to downgrade to Python 3.9.7.\n\n\n## PyInstaller resources\n\nHere is where I look for information when I need it:\n\n* PyInstaller documentation at <pyinstaller.readthedocs.io>\n* FAQ at <https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/FAQ>\n* [\u201cIf things go wrong\u201d](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/If-Things-Go-Wrong) page\n* Stack Overflow (PyInstaller has its [own tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pyinstaller))\n\n## Building an application using PyInstaller\n\nA typical Python application will have a directory structure somewhat like this:\n\n```\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Makefile\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 make.bat\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 foliage\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __main__.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 data\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 foliage-icon.ico\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 foliage-icon.png\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... other application Python files ...\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pyinstaller-macos.spec\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pyinstaller-win32.spec\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.cfg\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n```\n\nThe procedure for using PyInstaller involves creating a configuration file (described below) and then running pyinstaller in the project directory. The configuration file references other files such as the source files in the application subdirectory. I write `Makefile` (for macOS) and `make.bat` (for Windows) rules to run `pyinstaller` with suitable arguments to run PyInstaller with the appropriate configuration file (for macOS or Windows, depending). An example of the basic command line for is:\n\n```sh\npyinstaller --distpath dist/win --clean --noconfirm pyinstaller-win32.spec\n```\n\nThe `--distpath` argument tells PyInstaller to put the output in the subdirectory `dist/win`; the `--clean` argument tells PyInstaller to remove temporary build files from previous runs.\n\n\n## The two types of applications that can be built by PyInstaller\n\nPyInstaller can build applications in two \"modes\": a so-called \"one-dir\" mode and a \"one-file\" mode. Foliage uses one mode for macOS and the other for Windows. The reasons for this are as follows.\n\nIn \"one-file\" mode, PyInstaller creates a compressed single-file archive of the application plus all the Python libraries and necessary system libraries (`.dll`'s on Windows) to create a self-contained, single-file application. This single-file app contains a bootloader program that is the thing actually executed when the user runs the app. This bootloader unpacks everything at run time into a temporary directory, and after that, starts the real Foliage application (all behind the scenes -- the user doesn't see any of this happening). However, this unpacking step takes time, during which nothing seems to be happening. Not only is this long startup time annoying for the user, but the lack of feedback can be very confusing (\"did Foliage actually start? how long should I wait?\"). The one-file app is great for packaging and distribution (because the result looks like any other application), but not for the user experience.\n\nIn \"one-dir\" mode, PyInstaller does not create a single-file archive; it leaves the files (the dependencies, dynamic libraries, data files, etc.) in a single folder, unpacked. Within this folder, there's a binary that is the program you actually run. The result is faster startup at run time because the unpacking step is unnecessary, _but_ the user has to know to find the right binary file inside that folder &ndash; a folder that contains dozens upon dozens of other files and folders. This is an even more confusing user experience. However, on macOS, unlike Windows, there's a feature we can use to advantage here. MacOS apps are _already_ folders: in the Finder, a program that looks like it's named `Foliage` is actually a folder named `Foliage.app`, and inside this folder are various files and subfolders. So it doesn't matter if we use PyInstaller's one-dir mode, because we can hide the results in the Foliage.app folder and the user doesn't need to know about these details. As a result, we take advantage of one-dir mode for its faster start times without compromising the user experience.\n\n\n## The PyInstaller configuration file\n\nAt the top level of an application such as Foliage, you will find configuration files for using PyInstaller for different operating systems. For the Library we\u2019ve only needed to build for Windows and macOS. The file name does not matter. Most people seem to name the file with a `.spec` suffix (e.g., `pyinstaller-win32.spec`) but the content of the file is actually Python code. This is handy because for some complex cases, you can add Python code to the specification file to accomplish some things beyond merely setting variables.\n\nPyInstaller has two ways of building applications: a so-called one folder approach, and a one file approach. The latter is what you might expect and is the method that produces the most \u201cnormal\u201d kind of application (\"normal\" to people used to using other desktop applications). The configuration file for a one-file application can have up to 5 main components, which take the form of objects named `Analysis`, `PYZ`, `EXE`, `BUNDLE`, and `Splash`. (The last is for a startup splash screen and is optional, but is used by Foliage on Windows.) Each of these objects take various keyword values. Most of the settings stay the same from application to application, and I end up copying an existing spec file to create new ones, then modifying the values in the file as needed. Many of the values are paths, and it\u2019s easy to figure out what needs to be changed.\n\nWhen trying to get a PyInstaller application build properly for the first time, the most common problems I\u2019ve experienced have been the following:\n\n* _Incorrect paths at build time_. This can be, for example, a path to an icon file that does not exist. The spec file needs to be adjusted, or maybe the missing file needs to be created.\n* _Incorrect paths at application run time_. All of the files that comprise the application, including data files (icons, other data), all get embedded by PyInstaller into the one-file executable, and at run time, your Python program needs to find them inside that executable. This means your code has to get the right path, and the PyInstaller configuration must put them where you think they are getting put. This is especially true for the list of files passed to the `datas` argument to the Analysis object. This sometimes takes some trial and error. The debugging tips below can help with that.\n* _Missing imports_. PyInstaller tries to figure out all the Python modules that need to be embedded inside the executable, but sometimes it misses some. Make sure that (1) the `requirements.txt` file is up to date, and (2) you run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` before running PyInstaller so that the Python environment you\u2019re using actually contains the version of the packages that are specified in the `requirements.txt` file. Despite all that, some imports can get missed by PyInstaller for obscure reasons. That\u2019s when you may have to adjust the value of the `hiddenimports` parameter to the Analysis object in the spec file.\n* _No Python interpreter in the executable_. For a while I was under the mistaken impression that PyInstaller bundled a Python interpreter in the one-file executable. PyInstaller **does not embed a Python interpreter in the executable**, as counterintuitive as that may be. Instead, it converts your code to an executable form, and includes necessary run-time libraries, and that\u2019s what gets run when you use your final application. The implication is that you can\u2019t run Python scripts from your application.\n\n## Debugging a PyInstaller configuration\n\nThe debugging loop goes roughly like this:\n\n1. In the spec file, set the parameter values `debug = True` and `console = True` for the `EXE` part.\n2. Run PyInstaller to create the executable.\n3. Try to run the executable on the command line. If it fails, look at the debugging output to try to figure out what went wrong. (Often it\u2019s a missing Python module.) Iterate this step.\n4. If the application provides a GUI, then once you get it to start from the command line (step 3 above), next try to double-click the executable to start it like a regular application. With the `console = True` flag, the PyInstaller app will open a console window when it runs, and if the application generates errors, you may be able to see them printed there. Work on fixing the errors, and iterate this step until your application works.\n5. Edit the spec file to set `debug = False` and `console = False`, and try to run the application again.\n"

        "description": "User-visible changes in this version:\r\n* :wrench: Update: this version updates the pattern used to recognize Catech accession numbers, because the accession number format seems to have been changed again by FOLIO.\r\n* :wrench: Update: the action buttons in the _Change records_ and _Delete records_ tabs are now colored blue instead of red. The original choice for red was motivated by a desire to warn people they were about to perform a dangerous operation, but using red in this context is also inconsisten from a user-interface perspective and probably confusing to some people.\r\n* :wrench: Update: Foliage now uses the storage APIs for items and holdings when doing deletions, instead of using the inventory APIs. The original motivation for using the inventory APIs for these operations was that the inventory API \"does more\" and might lead to more complete updates on the FOLIO server side, but because this hypothetical idea was not really ever confirmed and FOLIO's representatives use the storage APIs themselves anyway, the feeling now is that it's safer to just do what they do.\r\n* :wrench: Update: the documentation was a little bit out of date with respect to the current Foliage interface. This update brings it up for past recent changes as well as minor changes in 1.5.0.\r\n* :ant: Bug fix: the export button in the _Clean tab_ previously did not work because of internal coding errors. Fixed.\r\n* :ant: Bug fix: when exporting the results of deleting records, the order of the entries in the exported list confusingly did not reflect the order in which the deletion operations were actually performed. Fixed.\r\n\r\nThis version also includes some internal code cleanup that has no impact on functionality.\r\n",
