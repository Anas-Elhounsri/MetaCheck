If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"jbkunst/highcharter\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependences with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the highcharter project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to this\nproject you agree to abide by its terms.\n"

Thanks to @wwwjk366.\r\n* Adding `list` to `hchart` supported classes to work with the new data helpers.\r\n* Adding `hc_theme_sparkline_vb`, `hc_theme_hcrt` themes.\r\n* boost module is FALSE by default.\r\n* Modifying `highcharts_demo()`, adding caption and credit texts.\r\n* All vignettes were moved from the package to favor to avoid CRAN check NOTE\r\nand warning. The content was moved to  the new website of the package.\r\n* `htmlwdgtgrid.css` were removed from the yaml of `highcart` `hchart` widgets\r\nto avoid problems with others css frameworks when highcarter is used with shiny.\r\nNow `hw_grid` add `htmlwdgtgrid.css` automatically. \r\nAdditionally `hw_grid` gain new parameters:  1) `add_htmlgrid_css` To add or \r\nnot `htmlgrid.css` and 2) `browsable` -set as TRUE the default value- so now\r\nthere is no need to use htmltools::browsable #622 \r\n* Adding new `hc_add_yAxis`. Thanks to @nordicgit70.\r\n* Added option to switch to `rjson::toJSON` for better plotting performance.\r\nTo use execute `options(highcharter.rjon =TRUE)`. See #613.  Thanks to @nordicgit70.\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n\r\n* Removing deprecated messages by dplyr #633 #637 thanks to @hdrab127.\r\n\r\n## Deprecated\r\n\r\n* `hc_add_dependency_fa`, `fa_icon`, `fa_icon_mark`, please use fontawesome \r\npackage https://github.com/rstudio/fontawesome. See examples in the new\r\nwebsite.\r\n* `hciconarray`, please use now `type = \"item\"`\r\n* `hcspark`, please use `hc_theme_sparkline`\r\n* `hctreeemaps`, `hctreeemaps2`, please use `data_to_hierarchical`.",

After `hchart(df, \"line\", x = xvar, yvar, group = othervar)` \n  now: `hchart(df, \"line\", hcaes(x = xvar, yvar, color = othervar), ...)` and therefore\n  `...` are used like other highcharter functions for give highcharts arguments \n  to the series. See _charting data frames_ vignette.\n\n## New Funcionalities\n- `hc_add_series` is a generic generic function (#213). \n- New `hcmap` function to chart maps (#218). And use remote sources (#215).\n- New _charting data frames_ vignette (http://rpubs.com/jbkunst/230276) (#220). \n- New _charting maps_ vignette (http://jkunst.com/highcharter/highmaps.html) (#218). \n- `debug` as an option instead of argument. Example `options(highcharter.debug = TRUE)` (#216).\n- Upgrade to highcharts V5 (#154) (#208). \n- Added helpers & shorcuts for tooltip: sort and table (#206).\n- Added export-csv plugin to export chart data to CSV, XLS, HTML or JS array (#178). \n- Added Grouped Categories pluging (#172) (#193). \n- Added Tooltip delay pluging  (#181). \n- Added `is.highchart` according with _Best practices_ in http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S3.html (#179). \n- New themes:  `theme_firefox` (#191), `theme_tufte` (#190). `hc_theme_elementary` (#184). \n- `hchart.data.frame` doesn't override the color if the colum var have a hexadecimal color\n  format (#148).\n- Added `hc_size` function to change width and height (#146). \n- Add more data for nice examples: vaccines, weather radials, pkmn (#145). \n\n## Changes\n- renaming `hcwaffle` to hciconarray. The `hcwaffle` do not make a waffle!  (#242). \n- removing colize_vector function (#237). \n- `viridisLite` moved from imports to suggests (#236). \n\n## Bug fixes\n- Fix map using `mapbubble` (#209). \n- `hc_add_series_map` don't remove additional data (#188) (#189).\n- `hc_annotations` accept multiple arguments (#171).\n- Adding specific version of tibble (#159).\n- `hchart.data.frame` allow change stops in `hc_colorAxis` (#147). \n\n## Others\n- Remove underscore as dependencies (#214) (#210). \n",
