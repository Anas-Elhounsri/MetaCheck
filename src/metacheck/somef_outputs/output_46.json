Every two years, face-to-face interviews are\nconducted with newly selected, cross-sectional samples. The survey\nmeasures the attitudes, beliefs and behavior patterns of diverse\npopulations in more than thirty nations. Taken from the [ESS\nwebsite](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/about/).\n\nNote: The `essurvey` package was originally called `ess`. Since\n`essurvey 1.0.0` all `ess_*` functions have been deprecated in favor of\nthe `import_*` and `download_*` functions. Also, versions less than and\nincluding `essurvey 1.0.1` returned wrong countries. Please install the\nlatest CRAN/Github version.\n\nThe `essurvey` package is designed to download the ESS data as easily as\npossible. It has a few helper functions to download rounds (a term\nsynonym to waves to denote the same survey in different time points),\nrounds for a selected country and to show which rounds/countries are\navailable. Check out the vignette and other documentation in the\n[package\u2019s website](https://docs.ropensci.org/essurvey/) for more\ndetailed examples of the `essurvey` package.\n"

Instead of the `import_*` functions, use the\n`download_*` functions.\n``` r\ndownload_rounds(c(1, 2),\n                output_dir = \"my/new/directory\",\n                format = 'spss')\n```\n \nThis will save the ESS rounds into separate folders and unzip them in\nthe specified directory (if you want to know your current directory,\ntype `getwd()`). This works the same way for `download_country()`. Be\naware that if you download the files manually you should read them into\nR with the `haven` package for all `essurvey` related functions to work. \nPlease note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of\nConduct](https://docs.ropensci.org/essurvey/CONDUCT.html).

        "description": "## essurvey 1.0.3\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n\r\n* If you don't know which format is available for a round/country, `import_*` and `download_*` functions now accept a NULL argument which runs through `'stata'`, `'spss'` and `'sas'` formats automatically. By default, `import_*` functions have now format set to `NULL` to automatically try the three different formats. This breaks backward dependency but only slightly where it had 'stata' set as default.\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n* Users can now download SDDF (weight data) for each country/round combination of files. Functions `show_sddf_cntrounds`, `import_sddf_country` and `download_sddf_country` are now introduced. For technical purposes, `show_sddf_cntrounds` needs for the user to have set their registered ESS email with `set_email`. [#9]\r\n\r\n### Minor changes\r\n\r\n* Bumps `haven` to minimum package version 2.1.1\r\n* New package website at https://docs.ropensci.org/essurvey\r\n\r\n### Internal\r\n\r\n* `read_format_data` now tries to read data using `haven` but falls backs to `foreign` in case there's an error. This should only work for SDDF data [#38].\r\n* `read_format_data` and `read_sddf_data` now always return a list. Checking the length of data to return a data frame now happens within each `import_*` function.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Removes an unnecessary if statement in `set_email` that didn't allow to overwrite the email once set.",

Typically, the\nEuropean Social Survey data files comes with a script that recodes\nmissing values to `NA` for different programs (Stata, SPSS, SAS).\n\nUse `recode_missings` to recode all values automatically.\n\n``` r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\none_round <-\n  import_rounds(1) %>%\n  recode_missings()\n```\n\nSee the package vignette for greater detail or see the help page with\n`?recode_missings`. You can also download several rounds by supplying\nthe number of rounds.\n\n``` r\nfive_rounds <- import_rounds(1:5)\n```\n\nThis will download all latest versions of rounds 1 through 5 and return\na list of length 5 with each round as a data frame inside the list.\n\nYou can check the available rounds with `show_rounds()` because if you\nsupply a non existent round, the function will return an error.\n\n``` r\ntwo_rounds <- import_rounds(c(1, 22))\n#> Error in round_url(rounds) : \n#> ESS round 22 is not a available. Check show_rounds() \n```\n\nAlternatively, you can download all available rounds with\n`import_all_rounds()`.\n\nYou can also download rounds by country:\n\n``` r\ndk_two <- import_country(\"Denmark\", 1:2)\n```\n\nUse `show_countries()` to see available countries and\n`show_country_rounds(\"Denmark\")` to see available rounds for chosen\ncountry. Alternatively, use `import_all_cntrounds()` to download all\navailable rounds of a country.\n\nYou should be be aware that data from the ESS survey should by analyzed\nby taking into consideration the sampling and weights of the survey. A\nuseful example comes from the work of Anthony Damico and Daniel Oberski\n[here](http://asdfree.com/european-social-survey-ess.html).\n"
