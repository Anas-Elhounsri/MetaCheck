Create a [fork][fork-explanation] of this repository, and [clone][clone-explanation] it to your local computer.\n2. In your local copy of this repository, create a new [branch][branch-explanation].\n3. Commit your changes to that branch.\n4. Push the edits on that branch to your fork on GitHub.\n5. Submit a pull request to the master repository (`UofTCoders/rcourse`).\n6. Your pull request will trigger a [Travis][travis-website] build (see below for details).\n7. If you receive feedback on your pull request, or encounter errors in the Travis build, \nmake further commits to the new branch on your fork. These will automatically be added to \nyour pull request. \n\nYou may wish to look at [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][contribute]\nfor more detailed instructions. The [GitHub Glossary][glossary] is also a useful resource that explains\nGit-related terminology. \n\n## Continuous Integration with Travis\n\nWe use [Travis CI][travis-website] to test all materials in the course repo. Any changes\nin the form of a pull request will trigger a Travis build, where \nTravis will attempt to test the code in the repo,\n[knitting][knitr-explanation] all lesson materials in the process. \nAny errors will cause the Travis build to fail.\n\nPull requests can only be merged into the repo with a passing Travis build;\nthis is to ensure that all course material is functional. If you submit a pull\nrequest that does not pass a Travis build, a traceback to the error can be found \non the link to that pull request's respective build. \n\nMore on the practice of continuous integration can be found on [Travis CI's website][ci-explanation]. \n\n## Format\n\nWe follow a consistent format across all course materials. A lesson\ntemplate can be found [here][lecture-template].\n\n### Lessons\n\n1. All lesson material is in R Markdown (`.Rmd`) format.\n\n2. All lessons begin with a Lesson Preamble, subdivided into\n'Learning objectives' and a 'Lesson outline'. The outline should\nalso list approximate time requirements for each segment. \n\n3. Lessons include a mix of code chunks and text, organized using Markdown headers.\n\n4. Students should be able to follow the contents of the lesson from the text alone;\ni.e. the file should contain _all_ conceptual explanations.\n\n### Assignments\n\n1. All assignments are in R Markdown (`.Rmd`) format.\n\n2. Assignment files contain a numbered list of questions and are comparatively light on code.\nThey are designed such that students fill in answers by adding in code chunks of their own.\n\n3. Code chunks in assignments should mostly be limited to loading required packages,\ndownloading required data, or data cleaning if necessary. \n\n\n[branch-explanation]: https://help.github.com/articles/about-branches/\n[ci-explanation]: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners/\n[clone-explanation]: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/\n[contribute]: https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github\n[fork-explanation]: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/\n[github-flow]: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/\n[glossary]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/\n[knitr-explanation]: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html\n[lecture-template]: https://github.com/UofTCoders/rcourse/blob/master/_templates/lectures.Rmd\n[pull-requests]: https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/\n[travis-website]: https://travis-ci.org/\n"
