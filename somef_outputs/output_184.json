By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}\n    Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    {project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

        "description": "# Changes in version 1.1.1 (2025-09-11)\r\n\r\n## New functions\r\n\r\n- `correct_PMTLinearity()`: A helper function to correct luminescence\r\n  signals measured with a PMT for count linearity (#920).\r\n\r\n## Removed functions and deprecations\r\n\r\n- Functions `calc_Kars2008()` (defunct since 0.9.26),\r\n  `Analyse_SAR.OSLdata()` (since 1.0.0), `PSL2Risoe.BINfileData()`\r\n  (since 1.0.0) and `Second2Gray()` (since 1.0.0) have been removed from\r\n  the package. Their functionality can be found in functions\r\n  `calc_Huntley2006()`, `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`,\r\n  `convert_PSL2Risoe.BINfileData()` and `convert_Second2Gray()`,\r\n  respectively.\r\n\r\n- Function `get_Risoe.BINfileData()` has been removed as it was not used\r\n  and provided no benefits to the user (#945).\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n## `add_metadata<-()`\r\n\r\n- The function throws an error if trying to assign a `NULL` value\r\n  instead of silently ignoring it (#946).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_Al2O3C_ITC()`\r\n\r\n- The function returns early if the fitting of the dose response curve\r\n  fails (#979).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_Al2O3C_Measurement()`\r\n\r\n- The function allows to specify the `cross_talk_argument` as a numeric\r\n  vector of length 3, as was already documented (#930).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`\r\n\r\n- The function crashed if any of the curves had `NA` as its `recordType`\r\n  (#867).\r\n\r\n### `apply_CosmicRayRemoval()`\r\n\r\n- The `method` argument of `smooth_RLum()` was not reachable via `...`\r\n  as the `apply_CosmicRayRemoval()` already has an argument called\r\n  `method`. Now the `...` argument is called `method_smooth_RLum` and\r\n  works as expected (9b27467).\r\n\r\n- The function crashed if method = \u201cPych\u201d`and`MARGIN = 1\\` were\r\n  specified. The function now better validates its inputs and no longer\r\n  returns invisibly but normally (#987).\r\n\r\n### `calc_AliquotSize()`\r\n\r\n- The legend text now scales better at non-default cex settings (#849).\r\n\r\n### `calc_Huntley2006()`\r\n\r\n- If the user set the `n.MC` argument, this was also used in the fitting\r\n  of the dose response curve. This was not the expected behaviour, and\r\n  resulted in poor performance (a 2x slowdown for `n.MC = 10000`). This\r\n  regression was introduced in version 1.0.0 (#867).\r\n\r\n### `calc_MaxDose()`\r\n\r\n- The function crashed if `sigmab` was set to a very small value (#898).\r\n\r\n### `calc_MinDose()`\r\n\r\n- The function crashed when bootstrapping with `bs.M = 1`. Now the\r\n  `bs.M` parameter is silently reset to 2 in that case, although such\r\n  low values are discouraged as they may trigger a warning during loess\r\n  fitting (#900).\r\n\r\n- The function crashed when all rows in the input data set contained\r\n  `NA` values (#915).\r\n\r\n### `calc_Statistics()`\r\n\r\n- The computation of the weighted median is now correct, while before it\r\n  corresponded to the simple (unweighted) median (#905).\r\n\r\n### `fit_CWCurve()`\r\n\r\n- The function hanged on particularly small datasets as it tried to fit\r\n  too many components for the available data (#953).\r\n\r\n### `fit_DoseResponseCurve()`\r\n\r\n- The object returned now contains an additional `.De.raw` column to\r\n  store the calculated De value computed by the fitting function \u201cas\r\n  is\u201d, without setting meaningless results to `NA`. The `De` and\r\n  `.De.raw` columns differ only for `mode = \"interpolation\"`, where the\r\n  first sets the De to `NA` if negative, while the latter doesn\u2019t. It is\r\n  then up to the user to decide what to do with those values, bearing in\r\n  mind that they may be arbitrary when negative (#957).\r\n\r\n- The message reported for `fit.method = \"QDR\"` now states correctly\r\n  whether the fit succeeded or failed (#961).\r\n\r\n- The computation of De.MC, De.Error and HPDI for\r\n  `mode = \"interpolation\"` has been modified to account correctly for\r\n  possible negative De values resulting from the fit (#963).\r\n\r\n- Previously, a single `NA` value in the Monte Carlo results prevented\r\n  the computation of Highest Density Intervals (HPDI). This limitation\r\n  has been removed, and now HPDIs are reported in more cases (#976).\r\n\r\n- The columns of the `results$De` data frame are now reported in a\r\n  different order; an additional \u201cMode\u201d column reports the value of the\r\n  `mode` argument; columns meant for internal use have been moved to the\r\n  end and their names are now prefixed with `.` (#974).\r\n\r\n### `fit_LMCurve()`\r\n\r\n- The automatic correction of the x-axis limits when `log = \"x\"` is\r\n  specified and the lowest value is set to `0` threw the correct warning\r\n  but actually did nothing (38e4324).\r\n\r\n### `fit_OSLLifeTimes()`\r\n\r\n- The function ensures that the `signal_range` argument doesn\u2019t contain\r\n  negative values instead of crashing (#896).\r\n\r\n### `get_RLum()`\r\n\r\n- The function doesn\u2019t crash anymore on `RLum.Analysis` objects if using\r\n  the `record.id` argument removes all available records (#873).\r\n\r\n- An internal optimization increased the performance of the function.\r\n  The difference is not perceivable on single calls to `get_RLum()`, but\r\n  the change brings a visible speed up when `merge_RLum()` is called\r\n  over a sufficiently large number of `RLum.Analysis` objects (#875).\r\n\r\n### `merge_Risoe.BINfileData()`\r\n\r\n- The function gained argument `verbose` to allow disabling the output\r\n  from `read_BIN2R()` and `write_R2BIN()` (#950).\r\n\r\n### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`\r\n\r\n- The positioning of the y-axis label has been improved to be centred\r\n  around the zero line (#847). The z-axis tickmarks and labels are\r\n  better drawn at non-default cex values (#865).\r\n\r\n- The minor grid lines were drawn incorrectly in a rotated plot (#849).\r\n\r\n- Some plot elements didn\u2019t scale correctly at non-default cex values\r\n  (#861, \\#879).\r\n\r\n- The `frame` argument is now respected also when the plot is rotated\r\n  (#863).\r\n\r\n- The weighted median is computed correctly when `summary = \"median\"`\r\n  and `summary.method = \"weighted\"` are used (#905).\r\n\r\n### `plot_DoseResponseCurve()`\r\n\r\n- We added support for the `log` graphical parameter, which can be used\r\n  if the fit was obtained with mode other than `\"extrapolation\"` (#820).\r\n\r\n- The normal curve drawn as part of the histogram plot could appear very\r\n  jagged or even as a straight line, as it could happen that too few\r\n  points were actually used when drawing the curve (#843).\r\n\r\n- The legend symbols did not match anymore the plotted regeneration/dose\r\n  points. This also affected functions such as `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()` and\r\n  `analyse_pIRIRSequence()` (9ba54e65).\r\n\r\n- The legend positioning can now be controlled via the `...` argument\r\n  `legend.pos` (#959).\r\n\r\n### `plot_DRCSummary()`\r\n\r\n- The dose-response curve is now plotted as expected, after a regression\r\n  in 1.1.0 caused the function to produce an empty plot (#969).\r\n\r\n### `plot_DRTResults()`\r\n\r\n- Points didn\u2019t scale correctly at non-default `cex` values (#879).\r\n\r\n- Option `summary = \"weighted$median\"` is now officially supported\r\n  (#905).\r\n\r\n### `plot_Histogram()`\r\n\r\n- Option `summary = \"median.weighted\"` is now officially supported\r\n  (#905).\r\n\r\n### `plot_KDE()`\r\n\r\n- Outlier points didn\u2019t scale correctly at non-default `cex` values\r\n  (#879).\r\n\r\n- The weighted median is computed correctly when `summary = \"median\"`\r\n  and `summary.method = \"weighted\"` are used (#905).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RadialPlot()`\r\n\r\n- Option `summary = \"median.weighted\"` is now officially supported\r\n  (#905).\r\n\r\n### `plot_Risoe.BINfileData()`\r\n\r\n- Input arguments are validate more strictly to avoid unexpected crashes\r\n  in case of misspecification (#964).\r\n\r\n- The x-axis label for TL curves now reports temperature rather than\r\n  time, consistently with the data shown (#971).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`\r\n\r\n- The legend text now scales better at non-default `cex` settings\r\n  (#854).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Data.Curve()`\r\n\r\n- The function gained a new logical argument `interactive` that enables\r\n  interactive plotting of curves using `plotly::plot_ly()`. It requires\r\n  the suggested package `'plotly'` to be installed (e4746eaa).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`\r\n\r\n- Types `image` and `contour` gained more control of the contour line\r\n  labels through the argument `labcex`.\r\n\r\n- For plot types `\"image\"` and `\"multiple.lines\"` the `...` logical\r\n  argument `legend` was added.\r\n\r\n- Plot type `\"image\"` further gained a legend with support through `...`\r\n  for `legend.pos`, `legend.horiz` and `n_breaks` to control the number\r\n  of colours in the graphic.\r\n\r\n### `read_BIN2R()`\r\n\r\n- The `FNAME` metadata field is no longer left empty if the BIN-file\r\n  didn\u2019t specify one, but it\u2019s populated with the BIN-file name without\r\n  extension. This is the behaviour that was present up to version\r\n  0.9.26, but version 1.0.0 had regressed it (#928).\r\n\r\n### `read_XSYG2R()`\r\n\r\n- Add support for the new function `correct_PMTLinearity()` (#920).\r\n\r\n### `smooth_RLum()`\r\n\r\n- Add support for the Poisson smoother of Carter et al.\u00a0(2018), which\r\n  can be accessed by setting `method = \"Carter_etal_2018\"`. This is\r\n  helpful to ensure that the dark-background counts signals measured by\r\n  a photomultiplier tube follow a Poisson statistic, and smooths\r\n  non-conforming values according to an average over four neighbours\r\n  (#921).\r\n\r\n### `trim_RLum.Data()`\r\n\r\n- The function crashed if both values specified in the `trim_range`\r\n  argument exceeded the number of channels available (#871).\r\n\r\n### `use_DRAC()`\r\n\r\n- Report the message produced by the DRAC server more reliably in case\r\n  of error (#982).\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Remove defunct functions

        "description": "# Changes in version 1.1.0 (2025-06-11)\r\n\r\n## New functions\r\n\r\n- `remove_SignalBackground()`: A user-friendly method to subtract\r\n  background signals from various curves in `RLum.Analysis` objects\r\n  without resorting to `lapply()` loops. Depending on the record type,\r\n  the function identifies pairs of curves; for instance, if in a\r\n  sequence, a `TL` curve is immediately followed by another `TL` curve,\r\n  the second curve is recognised as the background signal, subtracted\r\n  using `merge_RLum()` and subsequently removed from the object (if\r\n  desired). Alternatively, a set of potential background curves can be\r\n  specified.\r\n\r\n- `remove_RLum()`: This function further completes the set of methods\r\n  that can handle and modify `RLum-class` objects. It operates on\r\n  `RLum.Analysis` objects or a `list` of such objects to remove unwanted\r\n  records from datasets. Although the function calls `get_RLum()` and\r\n  relies on its functionality, the new implementation facilitates a more\r\n  logical workflow and analysis pipeline.\r\n\r\n- `.as.latex.table()`: Converts `RLum.Results` objects where suitable to\r\n  `LaTeX` ready tables, for instance, objects produced by `use_DRAC()`.\r\n  The function has been present in the package as an internal function\r\n  for many years; now it is exported and better linked to make it\r\n  discoverable.\r\n\r\n## New datasets\r\n\r\n- `RF70Curves` is a new dataset consisting of two IR-RF curves measured\r\n  with the RF70 protocol. This new dataset provides a more realistic\r\n  example for `analyse_IRSAR.RF()`.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n- Function `get_Quote()` is no longer exported, but remains available as\r\n  an internal function. This is unlikely to affect any user of the\r\n  package, as the function was only meant to report a random quote at\r\n  startup (#644).\r\n\r\n- In the functions `fit_DoseResponseCurve()` and `plot_GrowthCurve()`,\r\n  the `fit.method` option `LambertW` was replaced by the more correct\r\n  term `OTOR`.\r\n\r\n- Argument `cex.global` has been removed from `plot_DoseResponseCurve()`\r\n  (and consequently also from `plot_GrowthCurve()`), and if set it will\r\n  be silently ignored. Users can set the `cex` graphical parameter via\r\n  `...` in its place (#831).\r\n\r\n- The `fit.method` and `fit.advanced` arguments of function\r\n  `fit_LMCurve()` have been removed. The default fitting method has been\r\n  changed from `port` to `LM`, and support for the `port` algorithm has\r\n  been removed. From now on, argument `fit.method` is silently ignored,\r\n  unless `fit.method = 'port'` is used, in which case a deprecation\r\n  warning is thrown (#793).\r\n\r\n- The fundamental physical constants used in the package (such as\r\n  Boltzmann constant, Planck constant, etc.) have been uniformed to\r\n  those reported in the [NIST Reference on Constants, Units and\r\n  Uncertainty](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/). This may affect\r\n  the numerical results of the following functions: `calc_FastRatio()`,\r\n  `calc_Huntley2006()`, `calc_SourceDoseRate()`,\r\n  `calc_ThermalLifetime()`, `convert_Activity2Concentration()`,\r\n  `convert_Wavelength2Energy()`, `fit_CWCurve()`, `fit_LMCurve()`,\r\n  `fit_SurfaceExposure()`, `fit_ThermalQuenching()` (#693).\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n### `analyse_baSAR()`\r\n\r\n- The function crashed if only one aliquot was kept (#834).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`\r\n\r\n- The function crashed if the number of `Lx` and `Tx` curves was not\r\n  equal when `structure = c(\"Lx\", \"Tx\")`, which is the default. The\r\n  check that the number of points within each pair of curves has also\r\n  been improved, and the function now produces more helpful error\r\n  messages (#616).\r\n\r\n- The function tests are now less rigorous for different `Lx` and `Tx`\r\n  sizes. While they should match, numerical rounding issues in the data\r\n  returned by the measurement devices could previously result in\r\n  rejection of records, although this had no actual meaning for the data\r\n  analysis.\r\n\r\n### `analyse_IRSAR.RF()`\r\n\r\n- The legend and subtitle texts now scale better at non-default cex\r\n  settings (#803).\r\n\r\n- The printing of progress bars and messages to the terminal can now be\r\n  controlled via the `...` argument `verbose`. Previously this could\r\n  only be done via the `txtProgressBar` argument (which is still\r\n  supported), but the new option makes the interface consistent with\r\n  most other functions (#805).\r\n\r\n- The `mtext` and `cex` options are respected if `method = \"None\"`\r\n  (#807).\r\n\r\n- The residual plot correctly respects the logarithmic transformation of\r\n  the x-axis when `log = \"x\"` or `log = \"xy\"` are specified (#814,\r\n  \\#825).\r\n\r\n- The function now deals correctly also with input objects containing\r\n  multiple curves (#816).\r\n\r\n- The residual indicator rectangle, which is drawn when `method` is\r\n  either `SLIDE` or `VSLIDE`, is also drawn when `log = \"x\"` (#821).\r\n\r\n- The plotting of the density is silently disabled if `n.MC = NULL`,\r\n  which avoids a spurious warning (#823).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_pIRIRSequence()`\r\n\r\n- The function now respects the `cex` graphical argument, and its plot\r\n  output has been subtly improved thanks to various fixes that have\r\n  occurred especially in `plot_DoseResponseCurve()` (#831).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_portableOSL()`\r\n\r\n- The function now returns an error if `mode` is something other than\r\n  `\"profile\"` or `\"surface\"`.\r\n\r\n- The `mode` argument was not respected when operating over a list of\r\n  objects (#673).\r\n\r\n- The function crashed when using `mode = \"surface\"` if the plotting\r\n  limits were too tight and left only one point (#675).\r\n\r\n- The check on the validity of the `signal.integral` argument has been\r\n  improved, and now it occurs only once, so at most one warning is\r\n  raised if the argument is set to a value exceeding the valid range\r\n  (#678, \\#680).\r\n\r\n- The function returns a clearer message when no x-coordinates were\r\n  measured and `mode = \"surface\"` was used (#682).\r\n\r\n- The `cex` and `type` graphical parameters can now configured via the\r\n  `...` argument (#684).\r\n\r\n- The expected sequence pattern of the input object is validated more\r\n  thoroughly to avoid crashes in case of misspecification (#687).\r\n\r\n- The graphical `...` argument `contour` never produced a meaningful\r\n  contour plot due to an internal error (#686). Along, arguments\r\n  `contour_nlevels` and `contour_col` are now supported through `...` to\r\n  better control the number and colour of contour lines.\r\n\r\n### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`\r\n\r\n- Add support for `fit.method = 'OTORX'` following the changes in\r\n  `fit_DoseResponseCurve()`; this change includes the new argument\r\n  `dose.points.test` that is only of use in combination with the `OTORX`\r\n  fit.\r\n\r\n- Add new graphical output if the measurements were single grain\r\n  measurements, in such case a disc with the position and grain number\r\n  marked in shown. This plot replaces the IRSL curve check plot, but\r\n  only for single grain data (#797).\r\n\r\n- The rejection criteria plot was rewritten and now provides an easier\r\n  to grasp visual feedback (#797, \\#798).\r\n\r\n- The `IRSL`/`Single Grain` panel swapped place with the rejection\r\n  criteria panel; the plot numbers remained unchanged to avoid\r\n  regression.\r\n\r\n- More code optimisation for better readability (#802)\r\n\r\n### `analyse_SAR.TL()`\r\n\r\n- A check on the `sequence.structure` argument ensures that a \u201cSIGNAL\u201d\r\n  entry has been specified (#779).\r\n\r\n### `calc_AliquotSize()`\r\n\r\n- The new argument `sample_carrier.diameter` allows to specify a value\r\n  for the diameter of the sample carrier, which up to now was hardcoded\r\n  to the very common 9.8 mm size (#623).\r\n\r\n- Several graphical parameters can now configured via `...` arguments,\r\n  so that the plot appearance can be fully customized (#671).\r\n\r\n### `calc_AverageDose()`\r\n\r\n- A bug in the implementation prevented the default plot settings from\r\n  being modified via `...` as advertised. Now custom settings are\r\n  respected (#658).\r\n\r\n### `calc_FiniteMixture()`\r\n\r\n- The function doesn\u2019t crash anymore if the `n.components` argument\r\n  specifies non-consecutive values (#691).\r\n\r\n- The function sometimes failed to plot some of the densities when the\r\n  number of components was set to a value of 8 or more (#704).\r\n\r\n- The density plots would not always be coloured completely, but\r\n  especially for high values of `sigmab` there would be an unfilled area\r\n  at the base of the densities (#706).\r\n\r\n- If the very first iteration over the components during plotting was\r\n  skipped, then the function crashed as a quantity computed only in that\r\n  iteration was not available. This happened for very specific\r\n  combinations of `sigmab` and `n.components` (#708).\r\n\r\n- Another crash occurred when height of the largest density curve could\r\n  not be estimated due to the presence of too many `NA` values in the\r\n  intermediate computations (#710).\r\n\r\n- The check for significance of each component added to the model has\r\n  been corrected to be more statistically rigorous (#703).\r\n\r\n- Blank gaps appearing to the sides of the proportion of components plot\r\n  for high number of components have been removed (#713), as well as\r\n  extra slices appearing due to rounding errors (#715).\r\n\r\n- The plot can be better configured via the new `plot.criteria` argument\r\n  to control whether the statistical criteria curves should be drawn.\r\n  Moreover, support for the `...` options has been added: `cex` to\r\n  control the overall scaling, `main.densities`, `main.proportions` and\r\n  `main.criteria` to set the subplot titles (#717).\r\n\r\n- Plots are now generated even when results contain `NA` values, as they\r\n  in general don\u2019t affect the plot. However, when that happens we report\r\n  it in the plot subtitle (#718).\r\n\r\n### `calc_Huntley2006()`\r\n\r\n- Support was added for multicore computations via the `cores` argument,\r\n  and for the nls-fitting control options `maxiter` and `trace`.\r\n\r\n- The fitting of the simulated curve with the GOK model has been made\r\n  more robust: when an initial fit of the model fails, the fit is\r\n  attempted again with 10 different values for `D0` and the best fit is\r\n  used. This should reduce the number of occasions in which the error\r\n  message \u201cCould not fit simulated model curve, check suitability of\r\n  model and parameters\u201d is reported (#660).\r\n\r\n- The function crashed if all simulated Lx/Tx values were identical and\r\n  approximately zero, which could happen if the `rhop` argument was set\r\n  to a large enough value (#725).\r\n\r\n- An error message has been improved so that it doesn\u2019t suggest setting\r\n  the \u2018fit.bounds = FALSE\u2019 argument if it has already been set (#729).\r\n\r\n- The computation of the x-axis limits has been improved to avoid having\r\n  too much unused horizontal space, especially for\r\n  `mode = \"extrapolation\"` (#731).\r\n\r\n- The scaling of the plot can now be controlled via the `cex` argument\r\n  (#735).\r\n\r\n- The plot margins are set more precisely and avoid the summary text to\r\n  be cut off (#737).\r\n\r\n### `calc_MinDose()`\r\n\r\n- The function now warns if the number of bootstrap replicates is too\r\n  low to perform the loess fitting (#721).\r\n\r\n### `calc_OSLLxTxRatio()`\r\n\r\n- The function returned a warning for wrong integral settings for the\r\n  `Tx` curve even if no `Tx` curve was provided.\r\n\r\n- The function does not check any more of different object types for\r\n  `Lx.data` and `Tx.data` but validate objects for allowed types (this\r\n  should have no user-visible effects).\r\n\r\n### `convert_Concentration2DoseRate()`\r\n\r\n- The function validates its input values more thoroughly (#613).\r\n\r\n### `extract_IrradiationTimes()`\r\n\r\n- The function tries a little bit harder to extract the correct duration\r\n  of TL steps, rendering the data output hopefully a little bit more\r\n  intelligible (#651).\r\n\r\n- The function gained a new argument called `return_same_as_input`, with\r\n  default value of `FALSE`. If set to `TRUE`, the input object (usually\r\n  an `RLum.Analysis` object or a `list` of them) is returned with\r\n  updated info elements for `IRR_TIME` and `TIMESINCEIRR`. This makes\r\n  the `RLum.Analysis` object compatible with functions that explicitly\r\n  search for those two objects, such as those in the\r\n  `'OSLdecomposition'` package (#752).\r\n\r\n### `fit_DoseResponseCurve()`\r\n\r\n- The function now allocates less memory for storing intermediate values\r\n  (#610).\r\n\r\n- Add initial support for `OTORX` fitting following Lawless and\r\n  Timar-Gabor 2024 (#677). The code implementation follows the Python\r\n  reference by [jll2](https://github.com/jll2/LumDRC/blob/main/otorx.py) with an addition for an allowed offset parameter `a` set if\r\n  `fit.force_through_origin = FALSE`. This also enables to support\r\n  `mode = \"extrapolation\"` (thanks to John Lawless for his input).\r\n\r\n- The code of the function was optimised in several places to improve\r\n  code readability and reduce redundant calls.\r\n\r\n- The models for `EXP`, `EXP+LIN`, `EXP+EXP` and `GOK` are now available\r\n  in C++. This cut the required computation times in half in benchmark\r\n  scenarios. More importantly, this performance scales with the number\r\n  of Monte Carlo runs.\r\n\r\n### `fit_EmissionSpectra()`\r\n\r\n- Fix crash when attempting to plot a frame with non-positive counts\r\n  (#761).\r\n\r\n### `fit_LMCurve()`\r\n\r\n- If the user asks logarithmic scaling in the y-axis, using either\r\n  `log = \"y\"` or `log = \"xy\"`, this is now ignored when plotting\r\n  residuals and component contributions (#755).\r\n\r\n- The plot has been slightly reworked to reduce the cases of \u201cmargin too\r\n  large\u201d errors and to work better at high settings of `cex` (#757).\r\n\r\n- Missing values in the input data are now silently removed (#759,\r\n  \\#763).\r\n\r\n- The plotting of residuals, component contributions and legend can now\r\n  be disabled, and the legend position can be controlled (#785).\r\n\r\n- The error computed when using option `fit.calcError = TRUE` is now\r\n  returned correctly, instead of being left to `NA` (#789).\r\n\r\n- Argument `bg.subtraction` also accepts the option `\"none\"` to disable\r\n  background subtraction even if `values.bg` is provided (#795).\r\n\r\n### `fit_SurfaceExposure()`\r\n\r\n- It is now possible to specify different values for the light\r\n  attenuation coefficient `mu` when a list of input data is provided\r\n  (#667).\r\n\r\n### `fit_ThermalQuenching()`\r\n\r\n- The `trace` option, which can be specified via the `method_control`\r\n  argument, is now respected.\r\n\r\n- The model now get internally reformulated into a mathematically\r\n  equivalent expression that is easier to fit. This should reduce the\r\n  number of occasions when the function fails to find a valid solution\r\n  and improve the uncertainty estimation (#696).\r\n\r\n### `get_RLum()`\r\n\r\n- The argument `subset` can now be provided as a character that\r\n  represents a logical expression. Before, it always required a logical\r\n  expression, but this may lead to odd effects due to the early\r\n  evaluation happening in R and might not be wanted. Providing `subset`\r\n  as a character is now a viable workaround in those situations.\r\n\r\n### `import_Data()`\r\n\r\n- The function uses the most common formats (BINX and XSYG) before\r\n  trying all others.\r\n\r\n### `merge_RLum.Data.Curve()`\r\n\r\n- The function does no longer stops for differing channel resolutions,\r\n  but it does issue a warning. The user is responsible for the\r\n  consequences.\r\n\r\n### `plot_DetPlot()`\r\n\r\n- The logic for multicore support was incorrect, which resulted in\r\n  always starting a parallel cluster even when `multicore = FALSE`\r\n  (#742).\r\n\r\n### `plot_DoseResponseCurve()`\r\n\r\n- The response curve always tries to the get the 0 point in the mode\r\n  `interpolation` and `alternate` (#677).\r\n\r\n- Minor graphical polish to limit overplotting and also plot a density\r\n  curve for the `L_n/T_n` signal.\r\n\r\n- If `mode = \"alternate\"`, the message that the equivalent dose could\r\n  not be fitted is no longer shown.\r\n\r\n- Argument `cex.global` has been removed and will be silently ignored\r\n  (#831).\r\n\r\n### `plot_DRCSummary()`\r\n\r\n- Add support for `fit.method = 'OTORX'` following the change in\r\n  `fit_DoseResponseCurve()` (#677).\r\n\r\n### `plot_DRTResults()`\r\n\r\n- The summary and legend texts now scale better at non-default cex\r\n  settings (#765).\r\n\r\n- Argument `given.dose` is better validated against misspecifications,\r\n  and setting it to 0 is equivalent to leaving it at its default `NULL`\r\n  value, which corresponds to avoiding data normalization (#767, \\#799).\r\n\r\n- The function crashed when multiple inputs were used with\r\n  `boxplot = TRUE` and all preheat values were identical (#769).\r\n\r\n- Plot title, summary text and legend are now better positioned (#773,\r\n  \\#774, \\#781).\r\n\r\n- A bug in the way colours and symbols are assigned to plot points has\r\n  been fixed (#777).\r\n\r\n- The horizontal axis doesn\u2019t include anymore a spurious extra tick that\r\n  didn\u2019t correspond to any aliquot (#783).\r\n\r\n### `plot_GrowthCurve()`\r\n\r\n- Add support for `fit.method = 'OTORX'` following the change in\r\n  `fit_DoseResponseCurve()` (#677).\r\n\r\n- Argument `cex.global` has been removed and will be silently ignored\r\n  (#831).\r\n\r\n### `plot_Histogram()`\r\n\r\n- The function now doesn\u2019t produce warnings when the input consists of a\r\n  single-column data frame, as it assumes that the De error is 10^-9\r\n  (#744).\r\n\r\n- The right margin is now smaller when errors are not plotted, as there\r\n  is no need to leave space for the standard error axis (#748).\r\n\r\n- The summary text now scales better at non-default cex settings (#750).\r\n\r\n### `plot_KDE()`\r\n\r\n- The function validates its input values more thoroughly (#635).\r\n\r\n- Setting `summary.pos` to one of \u201cleft\u201d, \u201ccenter\u201d or \u201cright\u201d resulted\r\n  in the summary table not being visible (#642).\r\n\r\n- Argument `output` has been removed, and it will be ignored if set\r\n  (#700).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RadialPlot()`\r\n\r\n- The function validates its input values more thoroughly (#639).\r\n\r\n- The legend text now scales better at non-default cex settings (#746).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Data.Curve()`\r\n\r\n- We added comprehensive support for base R plotting arguments utilised\r\n  by `plot.default()` and `par()`. This enhancement ensures that all\r\n  available arguments are fully supported (#646).\r\n\r\n- The function gained a new logical argument named `auto_scale`. When\r\n  set in conjunction with either `xlim` or `ylim`, this argument\r\n  automatically adjusts the plot range to align with the corresponding\r\n  settings for `xlim` or `ylim`. For instance, if a user intends to plot\r\n  OSL curves but initially selects the `xlim` range `c(10:30)` to\r\n  examine the background, the initial count values may be excessively\r\n  large, resulting in limited visibility. With the introduction of the\r\n  `auto_scale` option, the `ylim` values are automatically adjusted to\r\n  compensate for this scenario. The `auto_scale` argument is also\r\n  accessible through `plot_RLum.Analysis()` and `plot_RLum()` (#646).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`\r\n\r\n- The channel-wise background subtraction was essentially broken if a\r\n  background spectrum with the same setting was provided. The function\r\n  always calculated the arithmetic mean. This was fixed, and the manual\r\n  updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n- If a background spectrum was provided, the behaviour of the plot\r\n  output was sometimes hard to understand without knowledge of the\r\n  underlying code. This behaviour was improved and now `ylim` will also\r\n  affect the background spectrum if `bg.channels = NULL` (the default).\r\n\r\n- The function could crash if column names were missing and the\r\n  1bg.spectrum\\` argument was used (#726).\r\n\r\n### `read_TIFF2R()`\r\n\r\n- The argument `file` can now be provided as a `list` or a character\r\n  vector.\r\n\r\n- The function gained a new logical argument called `merge2stack` that\r\n  can be used if `file` is either a `list` or a character vector of\r\n  length \\> 1. If set to `TRUE`, images are combined into one image\r\n  stack.\r\n\r\n### `read_XSYG2R()`\r\n\r\n- A redundant computation has been removed, and the function is now\r\n  marginally faster on files when the detector is not a spectrometer\r\n  (#753).\r\n\r\n- Prepare import for an updated version of LexStudio2 (\\>=v2.31.1) where\r\n  the horizontal hardware binning finally works after \\>10 years, but\r\n  the changes introduce a lot of `NaN` values that would cause a crash\r\n  of the function.\r\n\r\n- Minor code refactoring for a small speed boost if spectrometer\r\n  measurements are imported.\r\n\r\n### `scale_GammaDose()`\r\n\r\n- Argument `plot_singlePanels` now works as documented, that is it\r\n  produces all plots in a single page when set to `FALSE` (default), and\r\n  one plot per page when set to `TRUE` (#698).\r\n\r\n### `sort_RLum()`\r\n\r\n- The sorting mechanism for `RLum.Analysis` objects has been enhanced.\r\n  It now enables sorting based on multiple parameters, including sorting\r\n  all available `info_elements` in a prioritised manner (#606, \\#620).\r\n\r\n- Sorting now works on a list of `RLum.Analysis` objects. If the list\r\n  contains elements of a different type, they are passed through\r\n  unchanged. The output is again a list (#620).\r\n\r\n### `structure_RLum()`\r\n\r\n- The function now returns a less messy data frame because it\r\n  encapsulates `.pid` and `info` as lists within the data frame. The\r\n  function is primarily used internally to facilitate a rapid\r\n  exploration of `RLum.Analysis` object structures. However, the change\r\n  may potentially break existing code in extremely rare circumstances.\r\n\r\n### `template_DRAC()`\r\n\r\n- The function now throws messages instead of warnings for wanted\r\n  coercions; however, it will be hard on failed coercions that would\r\n  cause `use_DRAC()` to fail.\r\n\r\n### `use_DRAC()`\r\n\r\n- The function now checks for DRAC specific URL parts if a custom URL is\r\n  provided; this avoids long searches for unspecific errors.\r\n\r\n- Due to the internal masking of submitted values, the initial row order\r\n  got mixed up; regression from \\#438. The order is maintained and the\r\n  row index corrected; in other words, the masking should now be again\r\n  invisible to the user.\r\n\r\n### `verify_SingleGrainData()`\r\n\r\n- The function crashed if an object originating from `read_XSYG2R()`\r\n  contained positions in its `info` field (#740).\r\n\r\n### `write_R2TIFF()`\r\n\r\n- The function now supports the export of more than one image slice.\r\n\r\n## Internals\r\n\r\n- The internal function `create_UID()` has undergone further\r\n  optimisation for speed, resulting in a significant performance\r\n  improvement. Additionally, it now generates a hash value with a\r\n  consistent length instead of a time stamp with a random number.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Reduce unnecessary allocations in

        "description": "# Changes in version 1.0.1 (2025-03-07)\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n### `analyse_baSAR()`\r\n\r\n- The number of aliquots used was only partially reported if no aliquots\r\n  were removed, resulting in an incomplete message in the output to the\r\n  terminal.\r\n\r\n### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`\r\n\r\n- The function now checks that an input object generated from an XSYG\r\n  file contains irradiation steps and returns an error if none are\r\n  available, instead of producing an unhelpful output (#588).\r\n\r\n- A regression in `plot_RLum.Analysis()` caused part of the plot of the\r\n  luminescence curves to be garbled (#589).\r\n\r\n- The function crashed on a file generated by `read_XSYG2R()` if the\r\n  number of curves available after removal of the irradiation step was\r\n  not enough for the the fading measurement to be analysed (#603).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_pIRIRSequence()`\r\n\r\n- The check on the minimum device plot size used to fail if only one\r\n  dimension was below our minimum threshold, and when it was incorrectly\r\n  triggered by the floating point values computed by\r\n  `grDevices::dev.size()`, which sometimes could be spuriously just\r\n  below threshold. We also changed the minimum device size from 18 to 16\r\n  inches (#593).\r\n\r\n### `calc_CosmicDoseRate()`\r\n\r\n- The function crashed if the number of depths provided exceeded that of\r\n  the densities and the latter contained more than one value (#595).\r\n\r\n### `calc_FadingCorr()`\r\n\r\n- The function sporadically returned an implausibly large error estimate\r\n  if any of the Monte Carlo simulations produced an outlier solution\r\n  (#597).\r\n\r\n- The function now allocates only as much memory as required if the user\r\n  specifies a value for `n.MC` other than `\"auto\"`, which brings a small\r\n  speed-up if fewer than 10 million samples are requested.\r\n\r\n- Input arguments are now more thoroughly checked to avoid warnings or\r\n  unhelpful messages (#599).\r\n\r\n### `calc_FastRatio()`\r\n\r\n- The function crashed if the input was an RLum.Analysis object (#586).\r\n\r\n### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`\r\n\r\n- The `xlim`, `ylim` and `zlim` parameters are now better validated to\r\n  avoid possible crashes if misspecified (#581).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`\r\n\r\n- The function reset incorrectly the graphical parameters for the case\r\n  `plot_singlePanels = TRUE`. This caused a regression in the plot\r\n  output from `analyse_FadingMeasurement()` (#589).\r\n\r\n### `sort_RLum()`\r\n\r\n- The function doesn\u2019t crash when multiple fields are specified,\r\n  although the actual sort at the moment occurs only on the first field\r\n  (#606).\r\n\r\n- Attempting to sort an empty object returns the object itself instead\r\n  of crashing (#608).\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Validate xlim, ylim and zlim in plot_AbanicoPlot() by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/582\r\n* Complete coverage for calc_CosmicDoseRate.R by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/583\r\n* Replace sapply(x, length) and similar with lengths() by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/585\r\n* Fix crash in calc_FastRatio() on RLum.Analysis objects by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/587\r\n* Check that irradiation steps are available if the originator is read_XSYG2R by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/590\r\n* Fix regression in plot generated by analyse_FadingMeasurement() by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/591\r\n* Fix the minimum device plot size checks in analyse_pIRIRSequence() by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/594\r\n* Tighten checks on inputs and consolidate code in calc_CosmicDoseRate() by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/596\r\n* Tighten the outlier threshold in calc_FadingCorr() by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/598\r\n* Improve validation and documentation of calc_FadingCorr() arguments by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/600\r\n* Improve validation against a character vector by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/602\r\n* Fix crash in analyse_FadingMeasurement() if not enough curves are available by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/604\r\n* Fix crashes in sort_RLum() if more than one field is specified by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/607\r\n* Don't crash when sorting an empty RLum.Analysis object by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/609\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1",

        "description": "# Changes in version 1.0.0 (2024-02-21)\r\n\r\n## New functions\r\n\r\n* `apply_Crosstalk()`, `calc_MoransI()`, `plot_SingleGrainDisc()` and\r\n`plot_MoranScatterplot()` were contributed by Anna-Maartje de Boer and Luc\r\nSteinbuch (#560). An introductory example on how to use these functions\r\nis available by executing `vignette(\"crosstalk\")`.\r\n\r\n* `calc_EED_Model()` models incomplete and heterogeneous bleaching of\r\nmobile grains after Guibert et al.\u00a0(2017). Along with the function, the\r\nnew `ExampleData.MortarData` data set was added.\r\n\r\n* `fit_DoseResponseCurve()` and `plot_DoseResponseCurve()` are two new\r\nfunctions derived from `plot_GrowthCurve()`: the first only performs the\r\nfitting of a dose-response curve, while the second plots it. This brings\r\ngreater flexibility and increased speed, as plotting is now independent of\r\nfitting (#141, fixed in #318).\r\n\r\n* `melt_RLum()`: Creates a new flat `data.frame` that can be used for instance\r\nin combination with `'ggplot2'`. It works only on `RLum.Data.Curve-class`\r\nand `RLum.Analysis-class` objects and lists of such objects.\r\n\r\n* `merge_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`: This new function allows to merge two or\r\nmore `RLum.Data.Spectrum` objects in different ways (#368, fixed in #419).\r\n\r\n* `add_metadata()`, `rename_metadata()`, `replace_metadata()`:\r\nThese function allow to manipulate the metadata of\r\n`Risoe.BINfileData`, `RLum.Analysis` and `RLum.Data` objects (#480, fixed\r\nin #514, #524, #525, #527, #534, #545).\r\n\r\n* `sort_RLum()`: Allows to sort the records of `RLum.Analysis` and\r\n`Risoe.BINfileData` objects according to a given slot or info element\r\n(#528, fixed in #571 and #576).\r\n\r\n* `view()`: Provides a shortcut to the `utils::View()` spreadsheet-like data\r\nviewer tailored to the objects in the package (#489, fixed in #490).\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n* We have dropped our dependency on the `readxl` package: functions\r\n`analyse_baSAR()` and `use_DRAC()` now do not accept XLS files anymore but\r\nCSV files instead (#237, fixed in #270). CSV files can be easily generated\r\nfrom XLS files by Excel or similar applications, or by reading them with\r\n`readxl::read_excel()` and saving them with `write.csv()`.\r\n\r\n* The `plot.single` option, which was available for several functions,\r\nsometimes under a slightly different name, has now been renamed to\r\n`plot_singlePanels` for overall consistency and clarity. Function\r\n`scale_GammaDose()` used that option but gave it the opposite meaning: now\r\nalso this function conforms to the rest of the package. The use of the\r\nolder names is now deprecated and will produce a warning (#351, fixed in #408).\r\n\r\n* The `NumberIterations.MC` option of `plot_GrowthCurve()` has now been\r\nrenamed to `n.MC` for consistency with other functions. Potentially affected\r\nare also `analyse_Al2O3C_ITC()`, `analyse_baSAR()`, `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`,\r\n`analyse_SAR.TL()`, `calc_Huntley2006()`, `calc_Lamothe2003()`,\r\nas they may pass that option `plot_GrowthCurve()` via their `...` argument.\r\nThe use of the older name is now deprecated and will produce a warning (#546,\r\nfixed in #547).\r\n\r\n## Renamed functions and deprecations\r\n* Function `Analyse_SAR.OSLdata()` is now officially deprecated,\r\n`analyse_SAR.CWOSL()` should be used instead (#216, fixed in #264).\r\n\r\n* Functions `CW2pHMi()`, `CW2pLM()`, `CW2pLMi()` and `CW2pPMi()` have been\r\nrenamed to `convert_CW2pHMi()`, `convert_CW2pLM()`, `convert_CW2pLMi()`\r\nand `convert_CW2pPMi()`, respectively. The use of the older names is now\r\ndeprecated and will produce a warning (#499, fixed in #503).\r\n\r\n* Function `Second2Gray()` has been renamed to `convert_Second2Gray()`\r\n(#498, fixed in #500).\r\n\r\n* Function `PSL2Risoe.BINfileData()` has been renamed to `convert_PSL2Risoe.BINfileData()`\r\n(#555, fixed in #556).\r\n\r\n## New dependencies\r\n* We have added package `\u2019vdiffr\u2019` as dependency in `suggests`. The package\r\nenables us to automatically verify the consistency of plot outputs generated\r\nby package functions against reference figures captured earlier. Although\r\nthis new dependency does not have any user-visible impact, it is required\r\nwhen building `\u2019Luminescence\u2019` from source. The primary advantage lies in the\r\ndeveloper's domain, as it ensures that modifications to functions do not\r\ninadvertently alter plot outputs.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n### `analyse_Al2O3C_CrossTalk()`\r\n* The function doesn't crash anymore if option `recordType` is specified and\r\nnone of the records in the data set is of that type (#487, fixed in #488).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_baSAR()`\r\n* Argument `XLS_file` has been replaced by `CSV_file` and, as mentioned\r\nabove, the function now only accepts CSV files as input (#237, fixed in #270).\r\n* Add support for `recordType` passed to `get_RLum` in the additional arguments.\r\n* Option `plot.single` has been renamed to `plot_singlePanels` (#351, fixed\r\nin #408).\r\n* The function crashed if the number of MCMC iterations was set equal to the\r\nthinning interval; on the other hand, we saw errors reported from JAGS if the\r\nnumber of MCMC iterations was not at least double the thinning interval. To\r\naddress this, we slightly retouched our automatic setting of the thinning\r\ninterval (which was problematic only if the number of MCMC iterations was\r\nextremely low); on the other hand, if a user sets a thinning interval that\r\nis too high, we now reset it to a lower value and raise a warning  (#407,\r\nfixed in #409).\r\n* The function crashed if a `Risoe.BINFileData` object was provided and the\r\nargument `irradiation_times` was set; fixed.\r\n* The function was supposed to remove non-OSL curves from the dataset, but\r\nit almost never did; fixed.\r\n* The function is more robust against input that may have been subset\r\ninconsistently (#517, fixed in #518).\r\n* The function doesn't crash but reports more helpful messages in case the\r\nuser overrides the default set of monitored variables using `variable.names`\r\nwithin the `method_control` argument (#521, fixed in #522).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`\r\n* The function crashed for a list input that led to `NULL` for various\r\nreasons (e.g., unsuitable set of curves). Here the self-call attempted to\r\nextract information from the results that did not exist in the first place\r\ninstead of returning `NULL`; fixed.\r\n* The produced `RLum.Results` object now also contains a column for the\r\ngrain (#553, fixed in #554).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`\r\n* The function now checks for the version of the BIN-file that originated the\r\n`RLum.Analysis` object given as input, and reports a message if a version\r\nolder than 5 was used (#281, fixed in #282).\r\n* The function doesn't crash anymore on some `RLum.Analysis` input files\r\n(#283, fixed in #288).\r\n* Option `plot.single` has been renamed to `plot_singlePanels` (#351, fixed\r\nin #408).\r\n* The function doesn't crash anymore if no record is left after removal of\r\nrecords with negative time since irradiation (#454, fixed in #456).\r\n* The function has been made more robust in the calculation of rho' (#558,\r\nfixed in #559).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_IRSAR.RF()`\r\n* The performance of this function has been improved for the \"SLIDE\" and\r\n\"VSLIDE\" methods, thanks both to tweaks in the C++ implementation of the\r\nsliding algorithm and in how that is managed on the R side. In particular,\r\nthe default number of sliding windows tested in the algorithm has been\r\nreduced from 10 to 3: this value is no longer hardcoded, but can be tuned\r\nthrough the new `num_slide_windows` setting (part of the `method.control`\r\noption), thus allowing to find a balance between computation time and\r\nquality of fit (#372, fixed in #388, #398 and #399).\r\n* The function is more robust against `sequence_structure` misspecifications\r\n(#393, fixed in #394).\r\n* Some data preparation steps where not correctly applied for `method = \"VSLIDE\"`\r\n(#396, fixed in #397).\r\n* Option `method.control` has been renamed to `method_control` for consistency\r\nwith all other functions in the package (#411, fixed in #412).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_pIRIRSequence()`\r\n* Option `plot.single` has been renamed to `plot_singlePanels` (#351, fixed\r\nin #408).\r\n* The produced `RLum.Results` object now also contains a column for the\r\ngrain (#553, fixed in #554).\r\n* The function now checks that the `sequence.structure` argument contains\r\nat least one IR step (#579, fixed in #580).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`\r\n* Option `plot.single` has been renamed to `plot_singlePanels` (#351, fixed\r\nin #408).\r\n* The function shifted the curves correctly in cases where the first channel\r\nis zero and a log-transformation on the x-axis is requested (#580, fixed in\r\n#531).\r\n\r\n### `apply_CosmicRayRamoval()`\r\n* Support has been added for the internal function `smooth_RLum` that can\r\nbe passed as new argument for `method`.\r\n\r\n### `calc_AverageDose()`\r\n* The function crashed if the data contained non-positive values: now these\r\nare removed before proceeding (#532, fixed in #533).\r\n\r\n### `calc_CentralDose()`\r\n* Argument `na.rm` is now deprecated: the function will now always remove\r\nmissing values, as otherwise the presence of any `NA` would propagate and\r\nproduce unusable results (all `NA`s) or buggy behaviour (#302, fixed in #304).\r\n* The function stops the fixed-point iteration for the computation of the\r\nprofile log-likelihood as soon as `sigma < 1e-16`, as allowing `sigma` to\r\nbecome zero leads to infinities and buggy behaviour (also fixed in #304).\r\n\r\n### `calc_FastRatio()`\r\n* A number of crashes related to input validation have been fixed (#471,\r\nfixed in #472).\r\n\r\n### `calc_FiniteMixture()`\r\n* Arguments `dose.scale` and `pdf.scale` were not used and have been\r\nremoved (#566, fixed in #567).\r\n\r\n### `calc_gSGC()`\r\n* The function crashed if the data contained negative errors: to avoid this,\r\nwe now take the absolute values of errors (#479, fixed in #481).\r\n\r\n### `calc_Huntley2006()`\r\n* Some crashes in case of model misspecification have been solved (#538,\r\nfixed in #539).\r\n* Some details in the implementation of the function have been optimized, and\r\nnow it is much faster than before. As part of this, we have changed the default\r\nsetting of the `rprime` vector that is used in the calculation of the natural\r\ndose response and the field saturation, so that more points are concentrated\r\nin the bulk of the distribution: this previously depended incorrectly on the\r\nnumber of Monte Carlo iterations requested, so this change brings an additional\r\nspeed boost. The default setting can be overridden via the `rprime` argument\r\n(#258, fixed in #541 and #542).\r\n* Fitting the \"GOK\" model on the unfaded data failed when the \"EXP\" model we\r\nuse to find a good starting point failed: in such cases, we try again using\r\nthe simulated fit (#549, fixed in #500; thanks to @SalOehl for reporting and\r\nproviding data to reproduce the error).\r\n* The natural/simulated curve was not plotted in the negative quadrant for\r\n`mode = \"extrapolation\"`, which made it harder to see where it extrapolated\r\nto (#551, fixed in #552; thanks to @SalOehl for reporting).\r\n\r\n### `calc_IEU()`\r\n* The code of this function has been consolidated to avoid duplication and\r\nmake its debugging easier: this has uncovered a small coding error and also\r\nled to some speed up (#429, fixed in #430, #431 and #432).\r\n* Some crashes in the function have been solved (#424, fixed in #433).\r\n\r\n### `calc_Lamothe2003()`\r\n* We addressed a long-standing issue regarding the calculation of the `Ln/Tn`\r\nerror after fading correction, which led to smaller than expected errors\r\n(#96, fixed in #296).\r\n\r\n### `convert_RLum2Risoe.BINFileData()`\r\n* The function could crash with a `incompatible types (from raw to character)`\r\nerror under particular circumstances; fixed.\r\n* The function would fail in edge cases where different objects are mixed\r\nso that certain fields for `METADATA` are already available but in the wrong\r\nformat; fixed.\r\n\r\n### `extract_IrradiationTimes()`\r\n* In some circumstances the function failed to update an existing BIN/BINX\r\nfile due to an incorrect way of subsetting an intermediate data frame of\r\nresults (#445, fixed in #446).\r\n* The function crashed if the info element `startDate` was missing in the\r\nirradiation curve; fixed.\r\n\r\n### `fit_CWCurve()`\r\n* The function crashed if the computation of the confidence intervals done\r\nin `confint()` failed. This has now been fixed, and in cases of failures we\r\nreport the error message received from `confint()` (#509, fixed in #510).\r\n* Argument `output.terminal` has been renamed to `verbose` for consistency\r\nwith other functions.\r\n* The function has gained the new `method_control` argument, which can be used\r\nto control the saving of the component contribution matrix in the RLum.Results\r\nobject it returns. This is now disabled by default: to restore the previous\r\nbehaviour, add `method_control = list(export.comp.contrib.matrix = TRUE)` to\r\nthe function call (fixed in #573).\r\n* In case of plot failure the function now is able to recover gracefully and\r\nproduce an output object (#574, fixed in #578).\r\n\r\n### `fit_EmissionSpectra()`\r\n* The function can now return a data frame with the values of all curves\r\nplotted, so that it's much easier to produce alternative plots, by setting\r\noption `export.plot.data = TRUE` within the `method_control` argument (#569,\r\nfixed in #570 and #573).\r\n\r\n### `fit_LMCurve()`\r\n* The function has gained the new `method_control` argument, which can be used\r\nto control the saving of the component contribution matrix in the RLum.Results\r\nobject it returns. This is now disabled by default: to restore the previous\r\nbehaviour, add `method_control = list(export.comp.contrib.matrix = TRUE)` to\r\nthe function call (fixed in #573).\r\n* In case of plot failure the function now is able to recover gracefully and\r\nproduce an output object (#574, fixed in #578; thanks to @LumTKO for\r\nreporting).\r\n\r\n### `get_RLum()`\r\n* If the `subset` option was used on info elements of an `RLum.Analysis`\r\nobject, it would return wrong results if the info element was not present in\r\nall records; fixed.\r\n\r\n### `import_Data()`\r\n* The function automatically determines the available import functions and ensures\r\nthat formats supported by the package are tested and used.\r\n* A minor change in the code enables the support of `character` vectors of\r\nlength > 1 as input (e.g., different file names). Furthermore, the function\r\nreceived more testing against a mixture of input formats. Therefore you can\r\nprovide many different files formats and the function will try to import them\r\nall in one go.\r\n\r\n### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`\r\n* If negative values were provided, the function sometimes produced wrong plots\r\nfor `z.log = TRUE` (the default); fixed.\r\n* Support for `tcl` and `tck` arguments via `...` was removed as they were\r\nnever used internally.\r\n\r\n### `plot_DetPlot()`\r\n* Option `plot.single` has been renamed to `plot_singlePanels` (#351, fixed\r\nin #408).\r\n\r\n### `plot_DRTResults()`\r\n* The function crashed if option `na.rm` was used alongside the `preheat`\r\noption but the data set contained no missing values (#474, fixed in #475).\r\n\r\n### `plot_GrowthCurve()`\r\n* The function is now implemented as a wrapper around `fit_DoseResponseCurve()`\r\nand `plot_DoseResponseCurve()`. There should be no visible user-facing\r\nchanges (#319, fixed in #322).\r\n* Support new `...` arguments for plotting (implementation in `plot_DoseResponseCurve()`) for\r\n`legend` (turn on/off legend) and `reg_points_pch` for fine grained control over the point shape.\r\n* Add `density_polygon`, `density_polygon_col`, `density_rug`, `box` as `...`\r\narguments to plot and add respective plot options\r\n* The function crashed for single grain data that sometimes caused a lot of\r\n`NaN` values during log conversions required for estimating the start\r\nparameters. The result was the error `object 'b.MC' not found`\r\n(#374; fixed)\r\n* For the non-linear choices of `fit.method` (`\"EXP+LIN\"`, `\"EXP+EXP\"`,\r\n`\"GOK\"` and `\"LambertW\"`), the function could get stuck in an endless\r\nloop when the number of parameters was larger than or equal to the number of\r\ndata points. This is now checked, and in those cases the method is changed\r\nto `\"LIN\"` (#381, fixed in #465).\r\n* We replaced `nls()` with `minpack.lm::nlsLM()` as it's more robust and can\r\nfind a fit in cases where `nls()` would fail. Please keep in mind that it\r\ndoes not mean that fit results in those cases make any sense,\r\nit just helps to avoid uncontained events in the R session (addresses #381).\r\n* Option `output.plotExtended.single` has been renamed to `plot_singlePanels`\r\n(#351, fixed in #408).\r\n* The function now supports a list of data frames as input, in which case it\r\ncalls itself on each element of the list and produces a list of `RLum.Results`\r\nas output (#405, fixed in #434).\r\n* The function reported negative dose values in the MC runs plot when using\r\n`fit.method = \"QDR\"` and `mode = \"extrapolation\"` (#504, fixed in #505).\r\n* Argument `NumberIterations.MC` has been renamed to `n.MC` (#546, fixed in #547).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`\r\n* Option `plot.single` has been renamed to `plot_singlePanels` (#351, fixed\r\nin #408).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Data.Curve()`\r\n* Argument `norm` is now better validated so that specifying an incorrect\r\nvalue returns an error instead of silently skipping curve normalisation (#250,\r\nfixed in #263).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`\r\n* The gradient between colours when `plot.type = \"persp\"` is now more\r\nconsistent and doesn't produce artefacts in the regions of transition\r\nbetween colours (#371, fixed in #380).\r\n* The function would crash if the `bin.rows` or `bin.cols` value was set\r\ntoo high or if `xlim` and `ylim` were set too tight (#415, fixed in #416).\r\n\r\n### `read_BIN2R()`\r\n* The function is now much faster: we have recorded an overall improvement\r\nof over 60% on a 46M file, with potentially bigger time savings for larger\r\nfiles (#298, fixed in #333, #355 and #360).\r\n* Argument `n.records` is now better supported for BIN files v3 and v4 and\r\ndoesn't lead to a crash when used in conjunction with the `fastForward`\r\noption (#343, fixed in #344).\r\n* Argument `zero_data.rm` was not correctly propagated if the input object\r\nwas provided as a list (#342, fixed in #345).\r\n* The `METADATA` fields that are not actually read from the BINX file in\r\ncase of a ROI record are now set to `NA` rather than being assigned the\r\nvalue from the previous record (#336, fixed in #360).\r\n* The `.RESERVED` slot is now kept in sync with the rest of the object\r\nwhen records are dropped from the input BIN/BINX file (#337, fixed in #348).\r\n* The function doesn't crash anymore when reading a file that contains a\r\nrecord with an unrecognised version after other records with a valid version\r\nhave been read (#352, fixed in #353).\r\n* The function doesn't crash anymore when reading a file that contains a\r\nROI record while using `fastForward = TRUE` (#356, fixed in #360).\r\n\r\n### `read_HeliosOSL2R()`\r\n* If the function encounters problems in the provided list of files, it shows\r\na more relaxed handling; throws an error but continues reading.\r\n\r\n### `read_XSYG2R()`\r\n* The new `n_records` argument now enables to control the number of records\r\nto import, which can be useful in case the file is faulty.\r\n* The function failed to import files when a directory name was provided;\r\nthis was a regression introduced in v0.9.25 and it has now been fixed.\r\n* The function truncated the terminal output under certain circumstances; fixed.\r\n\r\n### `scale_GammaDose()`\r\n* Option `plot_single` has been renamed to `plot_singlePanels` and was changed\r\nso that `plot_singlePanels = TRUE` will produce one plot per panel, for\r\nconsistency with other functions (#351, fixed in #408).\r\n\r\n### `template_DRAC()`\r\n* The function gained a new argument `file_input` that enables the creating of a DRAC template\r\nbased on an existing DRAC CSV file. This way, already available DRAC files\r\ncan be conveniently modified without having to call `use_DRAC()` first.\r\n* The template contained a couple of minor mistakes that got fixed along with a\r\nmore strict enforcement of the class of each field, which is now set as an attribute;\r\nthe change should have no user-visible effect.\r\n* The function now supports the conversion factors by Cresswell et al. (2018)\r\n(`Cresswelletal2018`).\r\nPlease ensure that the server supports that option.\r\n\r\n### `trim_RLum.Data()`\r\n* The function has been made more robust against misspecifications of its\r\n`trim_range` argument that could lead to crashes (#460, fixed in #461).\r\n\r\n### `use_DRAC()`\r\n* Support for DRAC v1.1 XLS/XLSX files has been dropped, users should use\r\nCSV files according to the DRAC v1.2 CSV template.\r\n* The function gained support for three new `...` arguments: `version_ignore`\r\nto ignore the DRAC version check, `user` and `password` to access password\r\nprotected websites.\r\n* The identifiers submitted to the DRAC server are now better randomized to\r\nto guarantee more confidentiality of the data transmitted (#435, fixed in #438).\r\n\r\n### `verify_SingleGrainData()`\r\n* **Potentially breaking old code!**: if `cleanup = TRUE` the result was not\r\nconsistent and produced a mixture of `RLum.Results` and\r\n`RLum.Analysis`/`Risoe.BINFileData` objects in particular when run over a\r\nlist, this was not what stated in the manual. Now the function indeed cleans\r\nup the object, hence if a list of `RLum.Analysis` objects is provided, the\r\nresult is a cleaned list of that object. If the clean-up ends up removing\r\neverything, the result is `NULL`.\r\n* The function doesn't crash anymore when applied to an empty list (#365,\r\nfixed in #366).\r\n* Silence the very talkative terminal output even if nothing was removed\r\nfrom a record for `cleanup = TRUE`.\r\n* The function now provides better terminal feedback if the selection results\r\nin an empty record.\r\n* Add a new logical argument `use_fft` that will apply an additional Fast\r\nDiscrete Fourier Transform (FFT) verification on the data if wanted.\r\n\r\n### `write_R2BIN()`\r\n* The function now supports the `verbose` argument, which can be used to\r\nsuppress output to the terminal (#442, fixed in #444).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Post release version bump by @mcol in

        "description": "# Changes in version 0.9.26 (2024-11-18)\r\n\r\n## Removed functions\r\n\r\n  - Function `calc_Kars2008()` (deprecated since version 0.8.1) is now\r\n    officially defunct, `calc_Huntley2006()` should be used instead\r\n    (\\#252, fixed in \\#257).\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n### `analyse_pIRIRSequence()`\r\n\r\n  - The function crashed with a object merge error if run in a loop\r\n    because of a `merge_RLum()` error. This was caused by a regression\r\n    while implementing the `n_N` calculation in `plot_GrowthCurve()`.\r\n    Potentially affected was also `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`.\r\n  - The function now shows a warning and sets `plot = FALSE` when option\r\n    `plot.single = FALSE` is set but the device size is too small. This\r\n    should prevent \u201cFigure margins too large\u201d errors.\r\n  - The function will not crash anymore during the plotting in another\r\n    edge case related to single grain data.\r\n\r\n### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`\r\n\r\n  - The function crashed for mixed set of `RLum.Analysis-class` objects\r\n    typically observed for single grain data, e.g., one object contains\r\n    only TL curves while all others contain the OSL/IRSL data from the\r\n    grain. As the function filters those records automatically, it\r\n    crashed because the aliquot number assignment internally relied on\r\n    the length of the object (regression, \\#373, fixed)\r\n\r\n### `analyse_SAR.TL()`\r\n\r\n  - The function now produces a more correct `rejection.criteria` data\r\n    frame (\\#245, fixed in \\#246).\r\n  - Several edge cases that led to crashes have been fixed (\\#147, fixed\r\n    in \\#247).\r\n\r\n### `get_RLum()`\r\n\r\n  - When the function was used on a list of `RLum.Analysis-class`\r\n    objects with the argument `null.rm = TRUE` it would remove all\r\n    `NULL` objects, but not elements that became `list()` (empty list)\r\n    during the selection; fixed.\r\n  - Fix an edge case that caused a rather non-expected, more visible\r\n    output problem. When curves were selected via `recordType` on\r\n    `RLum.Analysis-class` objects (or a list of them) containing only a\r\n    single `RLum.Data-class` object, the function returned the\r\n    `RLum.Data.Curve-class` object *regardless* of the selection in\r\n    `recordType`. In other words: if a user tried `recordType = \"TL\"` on\r\n    an `RLum.Analysis-class` object that contained only a single IRSL\r\n    curve, the function would still return that single IRSL curve\r\n    instead of an empty element. The reason for this behaviour was a\r\n    poor attempt to deal with `NA` in the `recordType` name that led to\r\n    missing values and unexpected behaviour for a logical comparison.\r\n    Now, before the subset happens, `NA` values in `recordType` are\r\n    converted to `\"NA\"` (a character), allowing us to fix the incorrect\r\n    subsetting.\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`\r\n\r\n  - Add support for `lphi` and `ltheta` light direction arguments for\r\n    `plot.type = \"persp\"`.\r\n  - Fix the reason for the unclear warning `In col.unique == col :`\r\n    `longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length`\r\n\r\n### `write_R2BIN()`\r\n\r\n  - Recently, non-ASCII characters in comments or file names have become\r\n    more common and that led to crashes during the file export. To avoid\r\n    this, now all non-ASCII characters are replaced by `_` before\r\n    writing them to the BIN/BINX files.\r\n  - The function now returns the file path of the export.\r\n  - Fix a bug that left connections open if the function crashed.\r\n\r\n## Internals\r\n\r\n  - Two new internal functions `.throw_warning()` and `.throw_error()`\r\n    sometimes flushed the terminal with messages if called (internally)\r\n    in particular circumstances. Now we maintain a stack of function\r\n    names, so that at any time we can report correctly the name of the\r\n    function where an error or a warning is thrown (\\#254, fixed in\r\n    \\#256).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Post release version bump by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/240\r\n* Don't use the bbmle::profile() try_harder option in calc_MinDose() by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/241\r\n* Remove the windows-2019 (oldrel) instance from the CI actions by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/242\r\n* Add the expect_snapshot_RLum() test helper and start using it by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/244\r\n* Correct the rejection.criteria data frame created by analyse_SAR.TL() by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/246\r\n* Fix crashes in analyse_SAR.TL() by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/247\r\n* Silence notes raised by R CMD check by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/249\r\n* Use add = TRUE with on.exit() by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/255\r\n* Replace the implementation of .throw_error() and .throw_warning() by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/256\r\n* Set calc_Kars2008() as defunct by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/257\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/compare/v0.9.25...v0.9.26",

        "description": "<!-- NEWS.md was auto-generated by NEWS.Rmd. Please DO NOT edit by hand!-->\r\n\r\n# Changes in version 0.9.25 (2024-09-12)\r\n\r\n**This package version requires R \\>= 4.3**\r\n\r\n## New functions\r\n\r\n- `read_HeliosOSL2R()`: New import function to support the new zero rad\r\n  Helios luminescence reader and its `.osl` file format. The output is\r\n  an `RLum.Analysis-class` object.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n### `analyse_baSAR()`\r\n\r\n- Fix \\#183 addressing an edge-case crash when the function was called\r\n  on an object containing no records of the appropriate type (#184,\r\n  @mcol).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_FadingMeasurements()`\r\n\r\n- Add `...` support to disable the blue trend line via\r\n  `plot.trend = FALSE`\r\n- Fix \\#175 to deal gracefully with the case when the size of Lx and Tx\r\n  doesn\u2019t match (#192, @mcol).\r\n\r\n### `analyse_portableOSL()`\r\n\r\n- Function did not respect argument `main`; fixed.\r\n\r\n### `convert_Wavelength2Energy()`\r\n\r\n- Fix \\#133 addressing cases where R throws an uncontained error when R\r\n  drops the object structure in very rare cases (#134; thanks @mcol)\r\n\r\n### `calc_Huntley2006()`\r\n\r\n- Improve success rate of GOK fitting of the unfaded data using a two\r\n  step approach: first an exponential fit is applied then this values\r\n  are used as start parameters.\r\n\r\n### `calc_Statistics()`\r\n\r\n- The skewness and kurtosis depended on number of MC samples (#122);\r\n  fixed with \\#123 (thanks to @mcol)\r\n\r\n### `calc_TLLxTxRatio()`\r\n\r\n- Function crashed for `Tx.data.background = NULL` (#129); fixed with\r\n  \\#130 thanks to @mcol\r\n\r\n### `calc_WodaFuchs2008()`\r\n\r\n- The function now officially supports numeric vectors and single-column\r\n  data frames as input (#200).\r\n- The function computed the number of breaks for the histogram\r\n  incorrectly (#197, fixed with \\#198).\r\n- The function now supports more types of `RLum.Results` objects without\r\n  crashing, although if the object contains only one data point it will\r\n  stop immediately to avoid problems with `nls()` (#199, fixed in\r\n  \\#219).\r\n\r\n### `extract_IrradiationTimes()`\r\n\r\n- If a BIN/BINX-file is provided, the function will now check that it\r\n  contains the same amount of data as the corresponding XSYG file a bit\r\n  earlier than before, thus avoiding a possible crash (#228, fixed in\r\n  \\#229).\r\n\r\n### `fit_CWCurve()`\r\n\r\n- Argument `output.path` has been removed, and a warning is raised when\r\n  attempting to use it (#207, fixed in \\#209).\r\n\r\n### `fit_EmissionSpectra()`\r\n\r\n- Parameter `input_scale` was not correctly propagated when the function\r\n  would self-call (#160, @mcol).\r\n\r\n### `fit_OSLLifeTimes()`\r\n\r\n- The validation of the minimum dataset size didn\u2019t account for the use\r\n  of the `signal.range` argument (#182, fixed by \\#195, @mcol).\r\n\r\n### `fit_SurfaceExposure()`\r\n\r\n- Fix \\#162 to remove a dimension mismatch if the input data contained\r\n  `NA`s, which would generate unexpected warnings (#163, @mcol).\r\n- The function doesn\u2019t stop anymore with an error if called on an\r\n  `RLum.Results` object (#165, @mcol).\r\n\r\n### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`\r\n\r\n- Argument `plot.ratio` will now throw an error on non-positive\r\n  numerical values (#221, fixed in \\#222).\r\n- The function doesn\u2019t crash anymore when setting `interactive = TRUE`\r\n  (#220, fixed in \\#233).\r\n\r\n### `plot_DetPlot()`\r\n\r\n- Argument `signal.integral.max` is now enforced to be greater than\r\n  `signal.integral.min`, as otherwise the computation of the number of\r\n  channels would produce `Inf` (#203, fixed in \\#206).\r\n- Fix a crash when using option\r\n  `analyse_function = \"analyse_pIRIRSequence\"` (#210, fixed in \\#211).\r\n\r\n### `plot_GrowthCurve()`\r\n\r\n- The function now calculates the relative saturation (`n/N`) using the\r\n  ratio of the two integrates. The value is part of the output table.\r\n- Argument `na.rm` has been removed: as of version 0.9.23, it was\r\n  defunct and only accepted `TRUE` as valid value and produced an error\r\n  otherwise, so there is no effective change in behaviour (#137, fixed\r\n  in \\#214).\r\n\r\n### `plot_Histogram()`\r\n\r\n- The function doesn\u2019t crash anymore when setting `interactive = TRUE`\r\n  (#186, fixed in \\#231).\r\n\r\n### `plot_KDE()`\r\n\r\n- It now officially supports numeric vectors and single-column data\r\n  frames, for which it assumes that the De error at each measurement is\r\n  10^-9 (#189, fixed in \\#194, @mcol).\r\n\r\n### `plot_NRt()`\r\n\r\n- The function reports an helpful message rather than crashing when\r\n  applied to an object of unexpected type or when there is a mismatch in\r\n  time values (#177, fixed with \\#179 by @mcol).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RadialPlot()`\r\n\r\n- The function doesn\u2019t crash anymore when a single-column data frame is\r\n  provided (#191, fixed in \\#212).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Data.Analysis()`\r\n\r\n- The function now supports all arguments from\r\n  `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`; before it had only basic functionality\r\n  for `RLum.Data.Spectrum-class` data.\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`\r\n\r\n- The plot function can now handle non-increasing column values for\r\n  plotting (with a warning).\r\n\r\n### `read_BIN2R()`\r\n\r\n- `ignore.RECTYPE` now supports numeric values, e.g., 128. Records for\r\n  this type will be ignored during import.\r\n- BINX-files with `RECTYPE = 128` will not crash anymore, thanks for\r\n  asking Anna-Maartje Boer and replying Karsten Bracht.\r\n- The function now stops graciously when attempting to read an empty\r\n  file (#225, fixed in \\#226).\r\n\r\n### `read_PSL2R()`\r\n\r\n- The function is out of the beta status, hence the flag was removed.\r\n- The `RLum.Analysis-class` object returned by the function gained a new\r\n  element `Sequence`, which is a data frame. with the measured sequence.\r\n  This way, if the original sequence was lost, it can still be extracted\r\n  from the `.psl` data.\r\n- If no `.psl` file was found the function got trapped in an infinite\r\n  loop (#127); fixed with \\#128 (thanks to @mcol)\r\n\r\n### `read_XSYG2R()`\r\n\r\n- Fix spectrometer data import for basically broken files.\r\n\r\n### `read_Daybreak2R()`\r\n\r\n- Fix \\#135 to improve detection of non-ASCII files (#140, @mcol).\r\n\r\n### `Risoe.BINfileData2RLum.Analysis()`\r\n\r\n- Fix a crash when reading an empty Risoe.BINfileData input (#215, fixed\r\n  in \\#224).\r\n\r\n## Internals\r\n\r\n- New internal function + tests added `.get_named_list_element()`. It\r\n  just does what the names says.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Don't let a 1-column matrix become a vector in convert_Wavelength2Energy() by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/134\r\n* Check length of g_value argument in calc_Lamothe2003(). by @mcol in https://github.com/R-Lum/Luminescence/pull/132\r\n* Fix crash in

Please DO NOT edit by hand!-->\r\n\r\n# Changes in version 0.9.24 (2024-06-07)\r\n\r\n**This package version requires R \\>= 4.3**\r\n\r\n## New functions\r\n\r\n- `trim_RLum.Data()`: This new function enables trimming off the number\r\n  of channels of all supported `RLum.Data-class` on the time domain. For\r\n  instance, an OSL curve (`RLum.Data.Curve-class`) has 1000 channels;\r\n  one may want to extract only channels 10 to 100. Moreover, sometimes,\r\n  `RLum.Data-class` objects have a different number of channels but are\r\n  otherwise measured with the exact time resolution. Until now, it was\r\n  possible to merge those curves, but the subsequent analysis usually\r\n  failed because most of the analysis functions check whether the number\r\n  of channels matches.\r\n\r\n- `import_Data()`: A convenience wrapper around all functions commencing\r\n  with `read_`. The functions steps through all functions and the one\r\n  that can import a file is chosen. This function simplifies writing of\r\n  scripts for different data formats.\r\n\r\n## The Thermochronometry functions (internal)\r\n\r\n- Add internal function to import thermochronometry XLSX sheets into R;\r\n  an R implementation of `STAGE1, ExcelToStructure`; the function has no\r\n  user visible use for the moment.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n### `analyse_IRSARRF()`\r\n\r\n- The function crashed for `RF_nat.lim` settings with two parameters;\r\n  fixed (thanks to Mariana Sontag-Gonzalez for reporting)\r\n- The function gained a new argument option for `method`: `\"VSLIDE\"`. If\r\n  set, the vertical sliding with the range set to `\"auto\"` is used for\r\n  the estimation of the equivalent dose.\r\n\r\n### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`\r\n\r\n- The function gained a new argument `trim_channels`. The default is\r\n  `FALSE` to do not break existing code. If `TRUE` OSL and IRSL are\r\n  curves are checked for the lowest number of channels on the curves and\r\n  then all curves are trimmed accordingly using `trim_RLum.Data()`. This\r\n  should fix an issue where data could not be analysed due to different\r\n  channel numbers erroneously produced by the luminescence readers.\r\n- The dose points names are returned as `factors` (which they are)\r\n  instead of `characters`, with their class in the correct order. If you\r\n  expect character values this may break existing code.\r\n- The `$data` element gained two new columns `ALQ` and `POS` where the\r\n  functions tries to store data about the running aliquot number and the\r\n  position of the aliquot in the reader. The latter can only be accessed\r\n  if this information was provided in measurement data (e.g., XSYG or\r\n  BIN/BINX)\r\n- The argument `rejection.criteria` gained a new option\r\n  `recuperation_reference` preset to `\"Natural\"` to specify the\r\n  regeneration reference dose point taken into account for calculating\r\n  the recuperation rate (suggested by Anna-Maartje Boer and Jakob\r\n  Wallinga)\r\n\r\n### `calc_Huntely2006()`\r\n\r\n- If the age is `NA` due to `Ln/Tn` values lower than the smallest\r\n  simulated `Lx/Tx` value, a warning with an explanation is returned.\r\n  Thanks to Christina Neudorf for providing the test dataset.\r\n- Better catch a few uncontrolled errors and improve the success of the\r\n  fitting (thanks to Salome Oehler for providing scripts and datasets)\r\n- Regression: The changes in the last version led to unexpected function\r\n  behaviour in cases where users tried the fading correction with only a\r\n  few dose points in the lower part of the dose-response curve because\r\n  the fits were no longer forced through the origin. This issue is now\r\n  corrected, and the user can use the argument\r\n  `fit.force_through_origin` (which is passed down to\r\n  `plot_GrowthCurve()`) to force the fit again through the origin\r\n  (thanks to Junjie Zhang for reporting the issue).\r\n\r\n### `convert_Activity2Concentration()`\r\n\r\n- The function did not work as expected if input was provided as\r\n  abundance and the output data frame was missing values; fixed.\r\n- The parameter `input_unit` now expects either `\"activity\"` (the\r\n  default) or `\"abundance\"` instead of `\"Bq/kg\"` or `\"ppm/%'`. The old\r\n  input parameters are still silently accepted.\r\n- **Potentially breaking change**: The naming of the output data frame\r\n  now reports SI unit conform values, i.e.\u00a0we `ppm` is no longer\r\n  acceptable because it might have different interpretations. To reflect\r\n  this change, in the function title we replaced \u201cconcentration\u201d with\r\n  \u201cabundance\u201d.\r\n\r\n### `read_BIN2R()`\r\n\r\n- Argument `n.records` can now be provided as a vector to specifically\r\n  select records for the import. All other records are skipped and not\r\n  imported. This can be useful in particular for very large\r\n  BIN/BINX-files because allows importing single records very quickly\r\n  without parsing the entire file\r\n- The function is now less talkative for zero byte records and stopped\r\n  spamming the console.\r\n- The function learned about `RECTYPE` 128 records and can now import\r\n  them (before those records were skipped). As it is in the original\r\n  format, these information are only appended to the BIN/BINX file,\r\n  means they do not really represent measurement data. *Please note that\r\n  this support is highly experimental!*  \r\n- The download of files now uses the new internal function\r\n  `.download_file()`\r\n\r\n### `read_Daybreak2R()`\r\n\r\n- The function gained the `...` argument for compatibility reasons\r\n\r\n### `read_RF2R()`\r\n\r\n- The function gained the `...` argument for compatibility reasons\r\n\r\n### `read_SPE2R()`\r\n\r\n- The function gained the `...` argument for compatibility reasons\r\n- The argument verbose was not fully respected; fixed\r\n\r\n### `read_TIFF2R()`\r\n\r\n- The function gained the `...` argument for compatibility reasons\r\n\r\n### `read_XSYG2R()`\r\n\r\n- Tries a little bit harder to determine the correct file path.\r\n- Returns the file path as `@info` object in the `RLum.Analysis-class`\r\n  output.\r\n- If the file is not readable it only shows the R error and not anymore\r\n  the internal error.\r\n\r\n### `plot_DetPlot()`\r\n\r\n- New argument `plot`: The function gained the new parameter `plot` to\r\n  provide the possibility to disable the plot output for more complex\r\n  operations\r\n- Additional input: The function now understands lists of\r\n  `RLum.Analysis-class` objects and iterates over those objects\r\n  automatically.\r\n- New argument `multicore`: As an addition to the list operation, the\r\n  function can let it run in a multi core session\r\n- The legend displayed the wrong labels for the equivalent dose and the\r\n  `Ln/Tn` values; fixed.\r\n- The legend is now disabled by default if no shine-down curve is shown;\r\n  it can be activated again manually using `legend`.\r\n- The par settings were not correctly reset; fixed.\r\n- The function now supports the `trim_channel` argument from\r\n  `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`\r\n\r\n### `plot_GrowthCurve()`\r\n\r\n- Edge case: If the `Ln/Tn` values was way below the fit and\r\n  `fit.method = EXP` was chosen for the fitting, the function still\r\n  returned a positive equivalent dose for `mode = interpolation`. Now\r\n  the returned value is `NA` since no interpolation was possible.\r\n- Minor graphical polish: the dashed lines are drawn to the end of the\r\n  plot area.\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum()`\r\n\r\n- The function knows how to process results produces by\r\n  `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`, `analyse_pIRIRSequence()` and\r\n  `analyse_IRSARRF()`; the functionality is very basic and for fast\r\n  reporting situations only.\r\n\r\n### `report_RLum()`\r\n\r\n- The file `*.Rds` file path download did not function anymore; fixed.\r\n- The function threw an non-conclusive warning; fixed.\r\n\r\n### `Risoe.BINfileData-class()`\r\n\r\n- The `show` method now knows about `RECTYPE` 128 and will account for\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n### `Risoe.BINFfileData2RLum.Analysis()`\r\n\r\n- The function learned about `RECTYPE` 128 records. Those records\r\n  contain ROI data from camera measurements and are skipped for the\r\n  moment because they do not really belong to measurement data. This may\r\n  change future.\r\n\r\n## Internals\r\n\r\n- Add internal download helper `.download_file()` for a more consistent\r\n  approach to detect URL schemes and download files across the package\r\n- Cover tricky edge case for the internal function\r\n  `.expand_parameters()`. The function is used to recycle and expand\r\n  function parameters if the input is a list object. It apparently\r\n  showed odd behaviour if a function was used in a loop with objects of\r\n  its own, e.g., `f(x = i + 1)`, then the function would recycle `i + 1`\r\n  and then evaluate `i + 1` in the function environment. Usually, this\r\n  should throw an error, but in particular, `i` is an object name\r\n  commonly used in loops, so the function went upwards in the\r\n  environments until it found the first `i`. However, this is not the\r\n  `i` inserted by the user. The result was that the loop did not seem to\r\n  work for no apparent reason. Now, `.expand_parameters()` evaluates\r\n  input in the parent environment before passing it down.\r\n",

        "description": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- NEWS.md was auto-generated by NEWS.Rmd. Please DO NOT edit by hand!-->\r\n\r\n# Changes in version 0.9.23 (2023-11-03)\r\n\r\n**This package version requires R \\>= 4.2**\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n### `analyse_portableOSL()` (**potentially breaking changes**)\r\n\r\nThe function received a major update, including an updated output\r\nobject. Please make sure that you read the changes before updating,\r\nbecause it may break your existing code!\r\n\r\n- New argument `mode` added with two options `'profile'` (the default)\r\n  and `'surface'`. The latter is intended for 2D surface interpolation\r\n  of luminescence signals and was newly added.\r\n- New argument `coord` added, to allow the user to provide a list or\r\n  matrix of xy-coordinates of the sampling position. If nothing is\r\n  provided, the coordinates are extracted from the file name or an index\r\n  is calculated.\r\n- The function now always translates input order in x and y coordinates,\r\n  to have the treatment consistent.\r\n- In profile mode, the function now returns also the dark count values\r\n  with their standard deviation. The dark counts can also be plotted in\r\n  the surface mode, although it probably does not make much sense.\r\n- `invert = TRUE` the y-axis is now also inverted and the inversion\r\n  works more consistently\r\n- `...` argument `grid` (enabled by default) for better parameter\r\n  reading\r\n- `...` argument `sample` was changed to `run` better complying with the\r\n  terminology of the PSL format, where\r\n- `...` argument `bg_img` was added to provide a background image (e.g.,\r\n  a profile photo) for overlay the sample name is called run.\r\n- `...` supports a lot more arguments to enable better plot\r\n  modifications in particular for the newly added surface interpolation\r\n  mode.\r\n\r\n### `calc_Huntley2006()`\r\n\r\n- The function can now handle `\"extrapolation\"` for `fit.method = \"GOK\"`\r\n  or `fit.method = \"EXP\"` and is therefore suited to additive\r\n  measurement protocols. This implementation has beta character and\r\n  needs further testing.\r\n\r\n### `read_PSL()`\r\n\r\n- Remove unwanted characters less aggressively from sample name; with\r\n  this new setting, coordinates can be passed.\r\n\r\n### `plot_GrowthCurve()`\r\n\r\n- The function crashed for the setting\r\n  `plot_GrowthCurve(..., mode = \"alternate\", fit.method = \"LambertW\")`;\r\n  fixed (#114, @Eiskeil, thanks for reporting).\r\n- Now throws a warning in\r\n  `mode = \"extrapolation\", fit.method = \"LambertW\"` of the standard root\r\n  estimation failed and hence the results can become inconclusive.\r\n- `fit.method = \"GOK\"` now supports fits that are not necessarily forced\r\n  through the origin.\r\n- If the calculated fit weights were invalid, the parameter was not set\r\n  always correctly set; fixed.\r\n- Non-user visible change: the fit formula is now extracted more\r\n  consistently and less error-prone.\r\n- If the first `Lx/Tx` value was very high, the x-axis origin in the\r\n  plot was not always shown by default. This was intended behaviour,\r\n  however, sometimes this causes confusion. Now the axis origin is\r\n  always shown. Still the axis limits can still be modified using `ylim`\r\n  and `xlim`. (Thanks to Salome Oehler for flagging this issue).\r\n- The fitted curve now always extends to the plot margins.\r\n\r\n## Internals\r\n\r\n- Adding new dependency to `'interp'`\r\n- Remove dependency to orphaned package `'plotrix'`; the code in one\r\n  affected function was replaced using base R code",

If you access columns index-based, you\r\n  have to double-check your code. The manual was updated accordingly.\r\n- A new `...` argument `sample` was added to allow adding information on\r\n  the sample for the plot\r\n- The function did not like sequences with only one pair of OSL/IRSL and\r\n  returned an error; fixed.\r\n\r\n### `convert_PSL2CSV()`\r\n\r\n- Add new argument `single_table` to enable the export of PSL data into\r\n  a single spreadsheet table (CSV file), each curve is represented by\r\n  two columns\r\n- Add new argument `extract_raw_data`, which allows extracting the raw\r\n  data convienently. Those data are already imported by `read_PSL2R()`\r\n  but they remain somewhat hidden in the `@info` slots of each\r\n  `RLum.Data.Curve` object.\r\n\r\n### `fit_LMCurve()`\r\n\r\n- If the argument `fit.calcError` was set to `TRUE` and the parameter\r\n  confidence interval calculation failed, the function stopped with an\r\n  uncontrolled error.

This has no\r\n  particular advantage over the base R functions, such as `write.csv()`\r\n  but is used internally in combination with other functions.\r\n\r\n### Internals\r\n\r\n- Fix outdated URL in `github.R`\r\n",

The fit and the fitting were not affected;\r\n    though.\r\n\r\n### `read_BIN2R()`\r\n\r\n-   The example in the documentation was a little bit too generic and is\r\n    now replaced by an example that works.\r\n\r\n### `write_R2BIN()`\r\n\r\n-   The running example was not working because it used outdated example\r\n    data. The example was replaced by a working example using an actual\r\n    BINX-file. (thanks @JohannesFriedrich for reporting, \\#110)\r\n-   The terminal output of the function could not be silenced. Now the\r\n    output (except for the progress bar, which can be switched off) is a\r\n    `message()`, allowing to disable the terminal output.\r\n\r\n## Internals\r\n\r\n-   Add new internal function `.add_fancy_log_axis()` to provide a more\r\n    sophisticated log-axis to plots if needed with minor ticks and\r\n    proper labelling.\r\n-   Fix wrong usage of `class()` where needed",

Please DO NOT edit by hand!-->\r\n\r\n# Changes in version 0.9.19 (2022-03-10)\r\n\r\n**This package version requires R \\>= 4.0.5**\r\n\r\n### New functions\r\n\r\n-   `extract_ROI()`: Light-weighted function to extract pixel values\r\n    from pre-defined regions-of-interest (ROI) from\r\n    `RLum.Data.Image-class`, `array` or `matrix` objects and provide\r\n    simple image processing capacity. While the function comes with a\r\n    simple control plot output, the results can be passed also to\r\n    `plot_ROI()`\r\n\r\n-   `write_R2TIFF()`: Export `RLum.Data.Image` and `RLum.Data.Spectrum`\r\n    objects or a list of such to TIFF Images. A convenient wrapper\r\n    around the function `tiff::writeTIFF()`\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n#### `merge_RLum.Results()`\r\n\r\n-   If elements of type `matrix`, `data.frame` or `vector` were merged,\r\n    usually attributes, additional to the standard attributes (e.g.,\r\n    `class` for `data.frame`) were lost during the merging. Now, such\r\n    attributes are preserved so far they are not of a similar name as\r\n    the standard object of the object element (e.g., `dim` for `matrix`\r\n    or `class` for `data.frame`). This small addition allows to merge\r\n    more complex objects and retain all attributes for further\r\n    processing.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_DRTResults()`\r\n\r\n-   The plot messed with the `par()` settings, which was problematic if,\r\n    for instance, a second x-axis was wanted; fixed.\r\n-   The function examples were not anymore up-to-date; fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_RLum.Data.Image()`\r\n\r\n-   Minor correction of the colour legend, which did always show the\r\n    highest value\r\n-   New `...` argument `zlim_image` to maintain a consistent z-scale\r\n    over a series of images.\r\n-   The colour stretching could fail for `lin` and a lot of zero values;\r\n    fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`\r\n\r\n-   Fixed a bug that let `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()` crash under very\r\n    particular circumstances due to a wrong conditional statement.\r\n-   If the count limits are oddly chosen, i.e.\u00a0`limit_counts` is smaller\r\n    than the actual number of counts on the z-scale, the function does\r\n    not crash anymore but replaces the value with the lowest possible\r\n    value.\r\n-   The argument `box` for the plot `persp` now accepts `alternate` for\r\n    the customized plot without the box usually drawn around the plot.\r\n-   The function now returns the adjusted matrix used for the plotting\r\n    regardless of whether the argument `plot` is set to `TRUE` or\r\n    `FALSE`.\r\n-   If the plot type is `persp`, the default, the \u201cviewing\r\n    transformation matrix\u201d is returned as an attribute `pmat`. This can\r\n    be further used in conjunction with the function `graphics::trans3d`\r\n    to add additional information to the graphic.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_FilterCombinations()`\r\n\r\n-   The function returned a wrongly calculated optical density, using\r\n    `log()` instead of `log10`; fixed.= Note: The shiny filter app was\r\n    not immediately affected because the values here were taken from a\r\n    spreadsheet.\r\n-   The output object is now invisible since the function\u2019s main purpose\r\n    is to plot a graphic and not return an object.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_ROI()`\r\n\r\n-   Add support for the new function `extract_ROI()`\r\n-   Add new argument `bg_image` to support background image plotting\r\n-   The numerical output is now consistently `invisble` as it is for all\r\n    plot functions in the package\r\n",

Please DO NOT edit by hand!-->\r\n\r\n# Changes in version 0.9.18 (2022-01-17)\r\n\r\n**This package version requires R \\>= 4.0.5**\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n\r\n#### Changes in `RLum.Data.Image` and removal of import `'raster'`\r\n\r\nThe S4 class `RLum.Data.Image` was heavily revised to strip\r\n`'Luminescence'` of the dependency to the package `'raster'` and replace\r\nthe functionality with base R functions and objects. The `'raster'`\r\npackage came in at an early stage of `'Luminescence'` to handle image\r\ndata. However, most of its massive feature set was never used, but\r\n`'raster'` caused a lot of trouble to many users and in our automated\r\ntests because of its own dependencies. Soon, `'raster'` will be retired\r\nand replaced by an even more powerful package called `'terra'`. This was\r\nour cue to make some serious changes instead of carrying forward this\r\nunfortunate implementation in `'Luminescence'`.\r\n\r\n-   Within the `RLum.Data.Image-class` image data are now stored in an\r\n    `array` instead of a `RasterBrick` object.\r\n-   The function `plot_RLum.Data.Image()` does not know any more about a\r\n    plot type `plotRGB`. However, the standard raster plot was even\r\n    improved. Please watch out, however, for changed arguments.\r\n-   The image format import functions `read_SPE2R()` and `read_TIFF2R()`\r\n    were modified to support the new class design.\r\n-   The corresponding example dataset was updated.\r\n\r\n#### Removal of `app_RLum()`\r\n\r\nThis function was essentially a wrapper around `RLumShiny::app_RLum()`\r\nwritten to promote `'RLumShiny'`; a package providing a graphical user\r\ninterface to `'Luminescence'`. `'Luminescence'` is essential for\r\n`'RLumShiny'`. However, this two-way dependency caused unwanted trouble\r\nonce the package `'raster'` was removed. By removing `app_RLum()`\r\n`'Luminescence'` comes lighter because it has fewer dependencies this\r\nunfortunate reverse dependency can be avoided. `RLumShiny::app_RLum()`\r\nwill still work as before, but it cannot be called anymore out of\r\n`'Luminescence'`. In summary, except for one function less, not much has\r\nchanged since both packages need to be installed to run the shiny\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n#### `convert_Activity2Concentration()`\r\n\r\n-   The function had had-coded conversion factors, now the factors are\r\n    calculated, making it easier to include new data, such as updated\r\n    half-life values.\r\n-   The documentation is extended and should now be read more clear.\r\n\r\n#### `use_DRAC()`\r\n\r\n-   The function now supports up to 5000 datasets, instead of before 33.\r\n    The function `template_DRAC()` was revised accordingly.\r\n",

The default is `TRUE`.\r\n\r\n### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`\r\n\r\n-   The keyword internally set for the font decoration `'plain'` was not\r\n    used in `get_Layout()`, where `'normal'` was expected causing the\r\n    function to crash in R-devel if the argument `legend` was used;\r\n    fixed (#108).\r\n\r\n### `plot_RadioPlot()`\r\n\r\n-   An additional line, e.g., `plot_RadialPlot(...,line = 1)` was not\r\n    always drawn where the user expected it to be seen; fixed (#106,\r\n    reported by Li Bo)\r\n-   The radial z-scale did not always extend to the limits of the data,\r\n    even if limits for the z-scale were set, leading to an odd graphical\r\n    offset and unsuitable plots; fixed (reported by Christina Neudorf)\r\n-   The plot now always draws the lower limit of the z-scale.\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`\r\n\r\n-   The parameter `records_max` removed more curves than required;\r\n    fixed.\r\n\r\n### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`\r\n\r\n-   The function gained a new argument `plot` that can disable the plot\r\n    and return the matrix used for the plotting instead. This may sound\r\n    a little bit awkward, but it adds enormous flexibility. The function\r\n    does a lot of internal transformations, such as binning or colour\r\n    calculations, which could not be used in other functions before. Now\r\n    the function can be \u2018misused\u2019 to create an output object ready to be\r\n    passed to other packages and functions, such as the package\r\n    `'plot3D'`.\r\n",

        "description": "## Changes in version 0.9.16 (2021-11-18)\r\n\r\n**This package version requires R \\>= 4.0.5**\r\n\r\n### New functions\r\n\r\n-   `combine_Dr_De()` This function allows to model dose rate and equivalent dose distributions to obtain an age from Bayesian modelling using both distributions. In the back, a couple of additional functions have been added to support this novel approach. This function requires [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io)  (supported through `'rjags'`) on your computer along with a couple of other R packages prompted to you when you first try to use this function.\r\n\r\n-   `plot_OSLAgeSummary()` Posterior distribution plot of ages. This function is used by `combine_De_Dr()`, however, it can be used as stand-alone plot.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`\r\n\r\n-   If run in a loop (e.g., with `lapply()`), merging of the results with `merge_RLum()` failed because the returned objects were not always strictly identical; fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`\r\n\r\n-   If all dose points were 0, the function crashed; fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `calc_CentralDose()`\r\n\r\n-   The output in element `output$summary` was confusing for `log = FALSE`. While the terminal output was correct, no differentiation was made between absolute and relative values in the output object depending on the `log` mode. Now two more columns were added to report the overdispersion always in absolute units (whatever that may be) and relative (thanks to Li Bo for reporting this problem).\r\n-   No claim on the unit (e.g., Gy or s) is made in the terminal output anymore because we do not determine this information. Instead, now \u2018abs.\u2019 for absolute is used.\r\n\r\n#### `read_BIN2R()`\r\n\r\n-   The function crashed if it was run in a loop and encountered non-supported files; fixed.\r\n-   The function does not crash anymore for zero-byte files but skips the import, returns a message and `NULL`.\r\n-   For BINX files created using an EM-CCD camera, the function created, under particular circumstances, invalid records that could not be further transformed; fixed (thanks to Anna-Maartje de Boer for reporting).\r\n\r\n#### `plot_RadialPlot()`\r\n\r\n-   The function does not mess anymore with the `par()` settings of other subsequent plots\r\n\r\n#### `plot_GrowthCurve()`\r\n\r\n-   The function crashed in combination with `analyse_SAR.CWOSL(...,fit.weights = TRUE)` for unfortunate Lx/Tx error values (means, `Inf`) caused by noise-like OSL data; fixed. Thanks to Frederik Baumgarten for reporting the issue.\r\n\r\n### Internals\r\n\r\n-   New dependency to the package `'mclust'` is required by the two new functions.\r\n",

The function was around quite some time\r\n    but was finalised only recently.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n#### General\r\n\r\n-   We removed `'magrittr'` from the dependency. It was never used\r\n    within the package or required for examples, but loaded for\r\n    convenience reasons to smooth the data analysis. However, with\r\n    R >=4.1, a native pipe operator (`|>`) became available and\r\n    `'magrittr'` is no longer needed (but can still be loaded by the\r\n    user via `library(magrittr)` if needed).\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`\r\n\r\n-   Minor graphical issue in the plot output: if the shine-down curve\r\n    did not start at 0 s, the integration limits were drawn incorrectly\r\n    (the calculation was correct, though); fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`\r\n\r\n-   The extraction of irradiation times, if irradiation curves were\r\n    provided (e.g., usually part of XSYG files), did not work reliably;\r\n    fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `calc_AverageDose()`\r\n\r\n-   The function aggressively reset plot areas also in cases nothing was\r\n    plotted; fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`\r\n\r\n-   If the input was of type `data.frame` the function struggled if the\r\n    `data.frame` had more than two columns. While this was clearly\r\n    indicated in the documentation, the behaviour was annoying, because\r\n    it made always an extra sub-setting necessary when working with\r\n    `data.frame`s comprising more than two columns. Now the function\r\n    discards all other columns except for the first two if the input is\r\n    a `data.frame`.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_GrowthCurve()`\r\n\r\n-   The function crashed if `fit.method = \"LambertW\"` and the `Ln/Tn`\r\n    largely exceeded the highest `Lx/Tx` point; fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`\r\n\r\n-   For `plot.type = \"image\"` the labels for the contour did not scale\r\n    for changed `cex` settings; fixed.\r\n",

        "description": "## Changes in version 0.9.14 (2021-07-21)\r\n\r\n**This package version requires at least R \\>= 4.0.5**\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n#### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`\r\n\r\n-   The function lost the parameter `output` (default `TRUE`), which was\r\n    superfluous because the output was calculated regardless this\r\n    option. Now the output is always returned, but invisible on the\r\n    terminal. This has no user-visible effect and does not break old\r\n    code.\r\n-   The function had a long-standing nasty bug that caused overplotting\r\n    if the function was called repeatedly  \r\n    with par settings different from the default `par(mfrow = c(1,1))`;\r\n    fixed.\r\n-   In the case, the plot was shown on different panels (e.g.,\r\n    `par(mfrow = c(1,2))`) in combination with the option `dots = TRUE`,\r\n    the function crashed with the cryptic message:\r\n    `Error in rep(20, length(dots.x.i) - 1) : invalid 'times' argument`;\r\n    fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`\r\n\r\n-   Apparently, the function never worked as intended for `XSYG` files;\r\n    fixed. To prevent further problems, a test was added that monitors\r\n    this functionality.\r\n-   The parameter `t_star` now supports `half_complex`, which uses the\r\n    long equation from Auclair et al.\u00a0(2003). The difference is of\r\n    theoretical nature, however, now the two values can be compared.\r\n-   The plotting speed was improved by limiting the number of shine-down\r\n    curves to a maximum of ten. Likewise, the lines showing the error\r\n    range is now a polygon instead of single lines.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`\r\n\r\n-   The function gained a new argument `records_max` enabling only a\r\n    limited number of curves to be shown in the mode `combine = TRUE`.\r\n    This avoids that a large number of curves become indistinguishable.\r\n    The first and the last curve are always shown, all other curves are\r\n    shown following an evenly distributed index interval.\r\n-   The `...` argument `sub` (sub title of the plot) for\r\n    `combine = TRUE` did not work properly due the R\u2019s partial matching\r\n    of arguments that conflicted with the argument `subset`. The\r\n    argument `sub` was now renamed to `sub_title` to prevent this error\r\n    from happening and support again subtitles.\r\n\r\n#### `verify_SingleGrainData()`\r\n\r\n-   Improve terminal and plot output\r\n-   Add minimal support for `...` to control plot output if wanted",

Now a meaningful message is shown and the function returns\r\n    `NULL`.\r\n-   The function did not flag a problem but just crashed for non-numeric\r\n    input; changed.\r\n-   The function is now a little bit less forgiving if `tc` was not set.\r\n\r\n#### `RLum.Data.Image-class`\r\n\r\n-   Add S4-methods to coerce from and to `list` and `array`\r\n\r\n#### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`\r\n\r\n-   Documentation for the parameter `y.axis` clarified along with a new\r\n    list of supported `...` parameters.\r\n-   Add supported for `graphics::par()` `yaxt` parameter to suppress the\r\n    y-axis using `yaxt == \"n\"`. Please note that in a such a case a\r\n    newly added axis via `axis(2)` needs to be adjusted otherwise the\r\n    scale is not correct.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_Histogramm()`\r\n\r\n-   If the input is of `RLum.Results-class` always the first element\r\n    will be plotted.

Works only for files created\r\n    by Ris\u00f8 TL/OSL readers.\r\n\r\n-   `calc_gSGC_feldspar()` Function to support the calculation of the\r\n    equivalent dose using the global standardised growth curve (gSGC)\r\n    for feldspar proposed by Li et al. (2015)\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`\r\n\r\n-   The function, applied to a list of `RLum.Analysis` objects, crashed\r\n    with a merge error under very particular circumstances after\r\n    throwing a fitting error; fixed (reported by Brice Lebrun).\r\n\r\n#### `fit_LMCurve()`\r\n\r\n-   The function additionally returns a `component_matrix` (if the\r\n    fitting was successful). The matrix contains xy-values obtained from\r\n    the fitting with the resolution of the input data.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_GrowthCurve()`\r\n\r\n-   The quality index for the comparison of the *D*<sub>*e*</sub> and\r\n    the *D*<sub>*e*</sub> estimated from the Monte-Carlo yielded > 100%\r\n    if `mode = 'extrapolation'`; spooky and fixed.\r\n-   The function caused a crash in `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()` for very small\r\n    *D*<sub>*e*</sub> error values and returned a user unfriendly error\r\n    message (`Error in temp.GC[, 2]/temp.GC[, 1]`). This was caused by\r\n    an unintentional type conversion to a `character` for very small\r\n    values (#103, thanks to @IMHarly for spotting).\r\n-   Add support for the Lambert W dose-response curve fitting as\r\n    suggested by Pagonis et al. (2020) (thanks to @vpagonis for\r\n    developing the math)\r\n-   Minor tweaks to improve the graphical output and avoid various\r\n    errors\r\n\r\n#### `read_BIN2R()`\r\n\r\n-   Only for BIN/BINX-file version 3 and 4: if the numbers of runs\r\n    exceeded 128, the number became negative; fixed.\r\n\r\n### Internals\r\n\r\n-   `'lamW'` added as new package dependency. This is needed to support\r\n    the Lambert W function as in the function `plot_GrowthCurve()`",

        "description": "## Changes in version 0.9.9 (2020-11-29)\r\n\r\n### New functions\r\n\r\n-   `calc_OSLLxTxDecomposed()` Calculate `Lx/Tx` ratio for decomposed\r\n    CW-OSL signal components by Dirk Mittelstrass\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_SAR.CWOSLOSL()`\r\n\r\n-   The default value for `rejection.criteria` is now `list()` instead\r\n    of `NULL`. As before, the default value means that internally set\r\n    rejection criteria are applied and hence this change should not\r\n    affect the behaviour of the function, but it allowed us to greatly\r\n    simplify the underlying code.\r\n-   The function did not check correctly for all record types, under\r\n    particular circumstances, some of the non-support curves could slip\r\n    through; corrected.\r\n-   If the input records were not of type `OSL`, `IRSL` or `POSL` the\r\n    function was supposed to return `NULL` but crashed instead; fixed.\r\n-   As implemented by `calc_OSLLxTxRatio()` the function now supports\r\n    `NA` values for the integrals. If set, sum curves are taken for the\r\n    calculation. This option enables a bunch of new possibilities to\r\n    test more experimental protocols without modifying the function.\r\n-   Following the `NA` support, all integral arguments are now preset to\r\n    `NA`. To avoid user errors, a warning is thrown each time the\r\n    function runs with integral limits set to `NA`.\r\n-   The identification of the allowed curves was further improved to\r\n    cover cases where users may want to provide experimental OSL curves.\r\n    Allowed are combinations where `OSL` is combined with additional\r\n    letters `[a-zA-Z]`. Everything else is, as before, ignored.\r\n-   The function now supports the input from the upcoming R package\r\n    `'OSLdecomposition'` by Dirk Mittelstrass and hence gained a new\r\n    argument called `OSL.component`.\r\n-   In particular circumstances, when no TL-curves were detected as\r\n    preheat, the function crashed; fixed (flagged by Dirk Mittelstrass).\r\n\r\n#### `calc_OSLLxTxRatio()`\r\n\r\n-   The function now supports `NA` as input for the `signal.integral`\r\n    and/or `background.integral`. If set to `NA` the sum of the count\r\n    values is used. This is useful if the users wants to process\r\n    component data that were already extracted and do not need integral\r\n    limits.\r\n-   The output of the function is not anymore invisible. This should\r\n    have no further effect.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_GrowthCurve()`\r\n\r\n-   Users sometimes complained about large uncertainties produced by the\r\n    Monte-Carlo runs to estimate the error on the *D*<sub>*e*</sub>,\r\n    which returns the standard deviation of the MC runs. Large standard\r\n    deviations are a result of large individual uncertainties (e.g.,\r\n    noisy data) provided as input. The function now returns,\r\n    experimentally, estimates of the highest probability density\r\n    intervals as an alternative. Beyond we may recall that the results\r\n    of the MC runs are always returned as a separate object by the\r\n    function. Means, users ca run any statistic of choice to best\r\n    estimate the uncertainties on the *D*<sub>*e*</sub>.\r\n\r\n#### `read_Daybreak()`\r\n\r\n-   The function threw a lot of warnings for the `*.DAT` after\r\n    `R >= 4.0.0` started to be more strict about embedded null bytes\r\n    within a character. The code was updated to a newer version and no\r\n    further warnings are shown.\r\n-   Under particular circumstances the function left open connections\r\n    behind; fixed.\r\n\r\n### Internals\r\n\r\n-   The automated tests now use consistently `testthat` >= 3.0.0.\r\n    Naturally this has no user visible effect, however, we found a\r\n    couple of minor bugs while updating the tests.",

        "description": "## Changes in version 0.9.8 (2020-11-16)\r\n\r\n### Important user affecting changes\r\n\r\n-   The version requires R (>= 3.5.0)\r\n-   We removed a few of our vignettes from the package. They are now\r\n    available on <https://r-luminescence.org/tutorials/>\r\n\r\n### New functions\r\n\r\n-   `read_RF2R()` Add support for importing spatially resolved RF\r\n    measurement results.\r\n\r\n-   `plot_ROI()` Visualisation of ROI data imported by `read_RF2R()`.\r\n\r\n-   `convert_Concentration2DoseRate()` by Svenja Riedesel and Martin\r\n    Autzen. This function converts radionuclide concentrations (K in %,\r\n    Th and U in ppm) into dose rates (Gy/ka). Beta dose rates are also\r\n    attenuated for the grain size. Beta and gamma dose rates are\r\n    corrected for the water content.\r\n\r\n-   `calc_CobbleDoseRate()` by Svenja Riedesel and Martin Autzen. The\r\n    function calculates the dose rate profile through the cobble based\r\n    on Riedesel and Autzen (2020).\r\n\r\n### Datasets\r\n\r\n-   `ExampleData.CobbleDate` new example dataset to be used in\r\n    conjunction with the function `calc_CobbleDoseRate()`. Contributed\r\n    by Svenja Riedesel and Martin Autzen.\r\n\r\n-   `BaseDateSet.Conversion`, `Cresswelletal2019` was changed to\r\n    `Cresswelletal2018`. The corresponding function `scale_GammaDose()`\r\n    was updated.\r\n\r\n-   `BaseDateSet.GrainSizeAttenuation.rda`: Grain size correction data\r\n    for beta-dose rates published by Gu\u00e9rin et al. (2012). Dataset\r\n    contributed by Svenja Riedesel and Martin Autzen.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_SAR.CWOSLOSL()`\r\n\r\n-   The function gained a new argument `plot_onePage`. If set to `TRUE`,\r\n    the plot output is gathered in one single plot window instead of\r\n    three.\r\n-   If the user decided for odd reasons to mix preheat steps recorded as\r\n    TL (signal recorded) and simple preheat (no signal recorded) the\r\n    function stopped with an uncontrolled error. Now the function is\r\n    more flexible. However, this comes at a cost, e.g., if the user\r\n    accidentally swaps the sequence order (such as OSL-TL, instead of\r\n    TL-OSL) this may remain unnoticed.\r\n-   For zero count data (e.g., observed in single grain curves), the\r\n    function crashed with a non-indicative error message because `NaN`\r\n    are usually produced if the recycling ratio is calculated; fixed\r\n    (thanks to Brice Lebrun for reporting the issue).\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_FadingMeasurements()`\r\n\r\n-   Typo correction in the manual and a better documentation of\r\n    supported `...` arguments\r\n-   The `ylim` argument can now be used to control the `'signal fading'`\r\n    plot output.\r\n-   While the x-axis of the fading curve output was correct, it probably\r\n    caused too much confusion, and now the values are shown with\r\n    superscripts, e.g., `10^0, 10^1` etc. If the number of data points\r\n    is too small, the function will fall back to the old representation.\r\n-   The function did not work properly for less than five data points\r\n    and stopped with\r\n    `Error in rep(rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.3), length(TIMESINCEIRR) - 5)` (thanks\r\n    to Annette Kadereit for flagging this issue)\r\n-   The function now shows also the normalised log-values under the\r\n    time-scale (#97)\r\n-   As it turned out, `t_star` did not work if the input was produced by\r\n    `read_BIN2R()`; fixed along with (#97)\r\n-   `t_star` now can be a function, e.g., `function(x) x+100`, which\r\n    would add a constant value to all `TIMESINCEIRR` values (#97).\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_IRSAR.RF()`\r\n\r\n-   The function learned to recognise input from `read_RF2R` and changes\r\n    the header labelling accordingly.\r\n-   An edge case crash that might occur in combination with the vertical\r\n    sliding has be sanitized.\r\n-   The text progress bar was not closed correctly, this could lead to\r\n    artefacts in the terminal output; fixed.\r\n-   The internal C++ function used for the curve sliding now uses\r\n    Armadillo vectors via `RcppArmadillo`. Depending on the platform\r\n    this gives a performance plus free house by at least 50%. However,\r\n    it comes at the cost of a reduced maximum vertical sliding range of\r\n    1e+07 (before 1e+08).\r\n\r\n#### `plot_RLum.Data.Curve()`\r\n\r\n-   The argument `norm` now supports the options `\"max\"` for a\r\n    normalisation to the highest point (the default), `\"min\"` for a\r\n    normalisation to the lowest point and `huot` for a normalisation\r\n    suggested by S\u00e9bastien Huot (#87) via GitHub\r\n\r\n#### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`\r\n\r\n-   The argument `norm` now supports the options `\"max\"` for a\r\n    normalisation to the highest point (the default), `\"min\"` for a\r\n    normalisation to the lowest point and `huot` for a normalisation\r\n    suggested by S\u00e9bastien Huot (#87) via GitHub. Please note that\r\n    `norm` only works if `combine = TRUE`.\r\n\r\n#### `report_RLum()`\r\n\r\n-   Function complained about missing header; fixed.\r\n-   Function threw warnings `Duplicate identifier 'root'`; fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `read_SPE2R()`\r\n\r\n-   The function threw a warning about truncated strings; the warning\r\n    was not relevant and is no suppressed.\r\n\r\n#### `verify_SingleGrainData()`\r\n\r\n-   The function did not always return a plot: Fixed.\r\n\r\n### Internals\r\n\r\n-   `Risoe.BINfileData-class` objects got a `as.data.frame()` S3-method\r\n    to allow a direct conversion into a single data.frames. Count values\r\n    are added in columns for each record (thanks to Annette Kadereit for\r\n    the idea).\r\n\r\n-   `structure_RLum()` for `RLum.Analysis-class` recycled rows in the\r\n    output `data.frame` if objects had more than one parent id (`.pid`).\r\n    This led to odd behaviour if functions expected (correctly) that the\r\n    number of entries in the `data.frame` returned by\r\n    `structure_RLum()`, cannot not have more rows than number of records\r\n    in the object. This could happen, e.g., after merging\r\n    `RLum.Data.Curve-class` objects. ow multiple `.pid` entries still\r\n    create only one string and the number of rows matches the number of\r\n    records in the object.",

        "description": "## Changes in version 0.9.4/0.9.5 (2019-09-20/2019-09-21)\r\n\r\n### Important user visible changes\r\n\r\n1.  **`plot_KDE()`** wrong error bars As it turned out, unfortunately,\r\n    the error bars produced by `plot_KDE()` had been wrong since 2014.\r\n    The input error values (2nd column in the data.frame) had been, for\r\n    reasons we cannot recall anymore, divided by two leading to an\r\n    improved visualisation of uncertainties. A big thank goes to Andrea\r\n    Junge (#93) who made us aware of this bug.\r\n\r\n2.  **The way the x-axis channels from BIN/BINX-files are generated\r\n    changed** So far, during the file import, minimum and maximum values\r\n    were taken, and channels were distributed equally according to the\r\n    number of available data points. Thanks to S\u00e9bastien Huot for a\r\n    constructive discussion.\r\n\r\n-   Example old behaviour: For an OSL curve recorded over 40 s with 100\r\n    channels, the first channel was set at 0 s, the last channel to at\r\n    40 s. Thus, the width of each channel was 0.404 s.\r\n\r\n-   Example new behaviour: For an OSL curve recorded over 40 s with 100\r\n    channels, the first channel is set to 0.4 s, the last channel to at\r\n    40 s. Thus, the width of each channel is 0.4 s.\r\n\r\n-   In other words, the first channel does not start anymore at 0 s, as\r\n    it is the case, e.g., in the *Analyst*.\r\n\r\n**Please note that these changes will impact your analysis results!**\r\n\r\n### Difference between version 0.9.4 and 0.9.5\r\n\r\nNon-used dependency to `'interp'` removed.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`\r\n\r\n-   The automated curve type recognition introduced with the last\r\n    release broke the vignette of the R package `'RLum.Model'`; now\r\n    refactored code prevent other people\u2019s code from breaking.\r\n\r\n#### `calc_CentralDose()`\r\n\r\n-   The function does not crash anymore with an odd error if `NA` values\r\n    are provided (#82 reported by S\u00e9bastien Huot).\r\n-   The function gained a new argument `na.rm` which is set to `FALSE`\r\n    by default.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_DetPlot()`\r\n\r\n-   The argument `analyse_function.control` now understands the\r\n    arguments `fit.method` and `fit.force_through_origin`.\r\n\r\n#### `calc_MinDose()`\r\n\r\n-   The final parameter estimates and their confidence intervals in the\r\n    console output are now always reported in their absolute values,\r\n    independent of whether the logged or non-logged model was used (#84\r\n    suggested by S\u00e9bastien Huot). This is a purely cosmetic change, and\r\n    no changes to the calculations were made.\r\n-   The values in the profile log-likelihood plots are now always given\r\n    in their absolute values, independent of whether the logged or\r\n    non-logged model was used (#84 suggested by S\u00e9bastien Huot). This is\r\n    a purely cosmetic change, and no changes to the calculations were\r\n    made. The output object still returns the original profile objects\r\n    with the logged values.\r\n-   Improved handling of values close to zero if `bootstrap = TRUE`\r\n    (#91, reported by Andrea Junge).\r\n\r\n#### `plot_GrowthCurve()`\r\n\r\n-   Remove rounding from numerical output values (#81 suggested by\r\n    S\u00e9bastien Huot); this affects all subsequent functions. However,\r\n    terminal and graphical output do not change.\r\n\r\n#### Internals\r\n\r\n-   The package `data/datalist` file listing the example data shipped\r\n    with the package was not correct (#85, CRAN comment); now corrected.",

        "description": "## Changes in version 0.9.1 (2019-07-30)\r\n\r\n### Removed functions\r\n\r\n-   `model_LuminescenceSignals()`: This wrapper function for the R\r\n    package `'RLumModel'` was removed due to changes on CRAN inflicting\r\n    a warning because the object is masked from `'package:Luminescence'`\r\n    each time `'RLumModel'` was loaded. In `'Luminescence'` the function\r\n    had no real scope, but provided a place holder to point the users on\r\n    the existence of the package `'RLumModel'`.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n#### `apply_EfficiencyCorrection()`\r\n\r\n-   The function now supports `RLum.Analysis` objects as input\r\n-   All allowed input objects can now be provided as `list` (self-call\r\n    support)\r\n-   Minor code polish\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_baSAR()`\r\n\r\n-   The manual stated that `RLum.Analysis-class` are supported, but\r\n    actually this is not true, it supports a list of `RLum.Analysis`\r\n    objects only.\r\n-   Some minor manual corrections.\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_SAR.CWOLS()`\r\n\r\n-   Add support for `POSL` data,before the function crashed (reported by\r\n    Alice Versendaal). `POSL` curves had been not listed as supported\r\n    curve types though.\r\n-   Improve dataset recognition (`OSL`, `IRSL`, `POSL`).\r\n\r\n#### `calc_Lamothe2003()`\r\n\r\n-   The documentation wrongly stated that an input `data.frame` should\r\n    have the columns `dose`, `De` and `De error`, indeed `dose`, `LxTx`\r\n    and `LxTx error` are expected (spotted by Jeong-Heon Choi)\r\n\r\n#### `calc_TLLxTxRatio()`\r\n\r\n-   The `LxTx.Error` is no longer negative, even if the subtraction lead\r\n    to negative count values (#78, reported by S\u00e9bastien Huot)\r\n\r\n#### `calc_SourceDoseRate()`\r\n\r\n-   The function learned about the half-life of Cs-137\r\n\r\n#### `fit_OSLLifeTimes()`\r\n\r\n-   `0` count values crashed the function for obvious reasons\r\n    (`a / 0 = Inf`), this can happen in particular for artificial\r\n    datasets. Now, if `0` is detected, count values are increased by\r\n    `0.1` (reported by Dirk Mittelstrass)\r\n\r\n#### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`\r\n\r\n-   If `summary = \"se.abs\"` was chosen, the abanico plot showed `se.rel`\r\n    instead; corrected (reported by Maryam Heydari)\r\n\r\n#### `plot_DRTResults()`\r\n\r\n-   Correct documentation, where it was erroneously implicated that the\r\n    `...` argument pipes all arguments,\r\n-   add support for argument `las`.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_GrowthCurve()`\r\n\r\n-   If the dose points included `NA` values the function crashed\r\n    unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n#### S4-classes and methods\r\n\r\n-   `RLum.Analysis-class`\r\n    -   Code polish (no visible changes)\r\n-   `RLum.Data.Curve-class`\r\n    -   Code polish and clarifying the documentation\r\n-   `RLum.Data.Image-class`\r\n    -   Conversion methods to a `matrix` and from and to `data.frame`\r\n        never worked as intended.\r\n    -   Code housekeeping\r\n\r\n#### Internals\r\n\r\n-   The `DESCRIPTION` file contained the string \u201c\\[upcoming\\]\u201d. This was\r\n    a left-over from the development version and is now removed.\r\n\r\n-   Version numbering is now again more R canonical consisting only of\r\n    three numbers (`stable.major.minor`). Development versions are only\r\n    indicated by `.9000` in the version number. Numbers after `9000`\r\n    (e.g., `9000-1`) indicate build numbers. Both is used for GitHub\r\n    build versions only.\r\n\r\n-   The file name `RisoeBINfileData-class.R` was changed to\r\n    `Risoe.BINfileData-class.R` for consistency reasons, however, this\r\n    has no further visible effect (#76, spotted by S\u00e9bastien Huot)",

        "description": "## Changes in version 0.9.0 (2019-04-21)\r\n\r\n`'Luminescence'` 0.9.X releases will be the last versions supporting\r\n**R** \\< 3.5.0.\r\n\r\n### Important R related changes (R \\>= 3.6.0)\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the base R function `sample()` was changed / corrected\r\n(see news on <https://www.r-project.org> for details). This function is\r\nused heavily within functions by `'Luminescence'` (e.g.,\r\n`plot_GrowthCurve()`). That being said, it means that old data\r\nre-analysed by `'Luminescence'` using R versions \\>= 3.6.0 will not give\r\nthe same results. Differences are small, however, they may significant.\r\nIf you want to reproduce your data, we recommend to use one of our\r\n[Docker images](https://github.com/R-Lum/RLumDocker) which include the R\r\nversion from the package release date.\r\n\r\n### New functions\r\n\r\n-   `convert_Wavelength2Energy()` Smooth and quick emission spectra\r\n    conversion from wavelength to energy scales\r\n-   `fit_OSLLifeTimes()` Fit and deconvolution of OSL lifetimes using\r\n    off-time measurements, i.e. after the stimulation was switched off.\r\n-   `plot_DRCSummary()` Summarise all dose-response curves from your SAR\r\n    OSL analysis in one single plot.\r\n-   `scale_GammaDose()` Scale the gamma dose rate considering\r\n    layer-to-layer variations in soil radioactivity. Contributed by S.\r\n    Riedesel and M. Autzen.\r\n-   `fit_ThermalQuenching()` Provide an easy option to fit thermal\r\n    quenching data and determine the activation energy.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and changes\r\n\r\n#### `apply_CosmicRayRemoval()`\r\n\r\n-   Thanks to black magic, this function now runs also over a list of\r\n    `RLum.Data.Spectrum` objects and and `RLum.Analysis` objects (also\r\n    nested in a list)\r\n\r\n#### `apply_EfficiencyCorrection()`\r\n\r\n-   The function produced a warning (\u201ccollapsing to unique `x` values\u201d)\r\n    on R-devel; fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`\r\n\r\n-   If the function was used in a self-call mode (object of type\r\n    `list`), the arguments contrary to what is written in the manual,\r\n    the arguments such as `signal.integral.min` had not been expanded\r\n    properly; no one complained, however, corrected.\r\n-   The argument `main` no also supports the input `list` in the\r\n    self-call mode.\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_SAR.TL()`\r\n\r\n-   The plot legend was not correct, if no dose points had been\r\n    provided; fixed\r\n-   The function returned a confusion warning; fixed.\r\n-   If background signals are provided, now the background subtracted\r\n    signal is shown automatically instead of the uncorrected curves\r\n    (suggestion by Tilmann Wolpert)\r\n-   The function now supports a list of `RLum.Analysis` objects as input\r\n-   The plot settings were sufficiently reset; fixed.\r\n-   Code polish\r\n\r\n#### `analyse_FadingMeasurements()`\r\n\r\n-   Enable support for data imported from a BIN/BINX-file\r\n-   If the g-value is negative, now it also returns a negative g-value;\r\n    before always the absolute values was taken, which was not\r\n    meaningful\r\n-   If rho was negative, the log10 value could not be calculated, this\r\n    caused an unwanted warning; now suppressed\r\n-   It showed a warning on R-devel due to changes in `stats::approx()`;\r\n    fixed\r\n-   Records with negative `time since irradiation` are now automatically\r\n    removed (thanks to input by S\u00e9bastien Huot)\r\n-   Function is now more relaxed when odd data a provided and it is less\r\n    talkative\r\n\r\n#### `calc_Huntley2006()`\r\n\r\n-   The function now checks if rho (`rhop`) is a sensible non-zero\r\n    positive value and, if otherwise, stops with a more meaningful error\r\n    message. (Issue #74)\r\n-   Now the function is a little bit less talkative if extreme dataset\r\n    are provided as input\r\n\r\n#### `read_BIN2R()`\r\n\r\n-   Add support for missing BINX-file version 5 (pointed out by Harrison\r\n    Gray)\r\n-   In the auto-file recognition (only a path instead of a file is\r\n    provided), sometimes the found BIN/BINX-files were imported twice.\r\n    The corresponding code was simplified to avoid such errors in future\r\n-   Sometimes the time stamp is invalid since it is missing a leading\r\n    `0`. For BINX-files >= version 6 such timestamps now get corrected\r\n    during the import\r\n\r\n#### `read_XSYG2R()`\r\n\r\n-   The function failed for R-devel importing spectrometer data\r\n    (`approx(..., ties = -2)`); fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_GrowthCurve()`\r\n\r\n-   The function crashed with\r\n    `Error in data.MC[, i] : incorrect number of dimensions` under very\r\n    particular circumstances (reported by Alice Versendaal). This was\r\n    due to unwanted internal object conversion; fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`\r\n\r\n-   The wavelength to energy scale conversion was not correct. This was\r\n    corrected and internally, the function now calls consistently the\r\n    new function `convert_Wavelength2Enegy()` (the corresponding code\r\n    and documentation have been updated or removed).  \r\n-   The function gained a new argument `norm` for normalising the data\r\n    to the highest or the lowest count value.\r\n-   The function gained a new argument `bg.spectrum` allow to pass a\r\n    background spectrum that can be used for the subtraction\r\n-   The function returned a warning if a single matrix was used but\r\n    `plot.type` was already set to `single`; fixed.\r\n-   Wrong settings in `bg.channels` crashed the function. Now it\r\n    auto-corrects the wrong values.\r\n-   Channel binning now consistently calls the internal function\r\n    `Luminescence:::.matrix_binning()`, which is more efficient cleaner\r\n    than the code used before\r\n-   The function now longer crashes for `plot.type = 'persp'` if\r\n    `'xaxis.energy = TRUE`.\r\n-   The colour picking option was not always working; fixed.\r\n-   Warnings are formatted more nicely.\r\n\r\n#### `verify_SingeGrainData()`\r\n\r\n-   The function crashed for crazy datasets; fixed\r\n-   Cleaning-up `RLum.Analysis-class` objects did not worked; fixed\r\n\r\n#### `write_RLum2CSV()`\r\n\r\n-   The function gained a new argument `compact` which is set `TRUE` be\r\n    default, and keeps the element output as simple as possible, which\r\n    is in particular helpful for `RLum.Results` objects\r\n-   The function now behaves more friendly to `RLum.Results` objects,\r\n    before the output was hard to understand.\r\n\r\n#### `write_RLum2BIN()`\r\n\r\n-   The export failed if the time stamp was invalid (`NA`); now `NA`\r\n    values are consistently replaced by `000000` (other values are not\r\n    possible, otherwise the re-import of such file would fail) (reported\r\n    by Alice Versendaal via email, 2019-03-06)\r\n\r\n### Changes in S4-objects and methods\r\n\r\n#### `get_RLum`\r\n\r\n-   The method working on `list` elements got a new argument `class` to\r\n    remove unwanted `RLum` objects in from list of `RLum` objects\r\n\r\n#### `RLum.Analysis-class`\r\n\r\n-   The show-method crashed under very rare circumstances if\r\n    inconsistent objects had been combined; fixed.\r\n\r\n#### `RLum.Data.Spectrum-class`\r\n\r\n-   Support added for `bin_RLum.Data()`\r\n\r\n### New example datasets\r\n\r\n-   `ExampleData.TR_OSL` provides a single fast-pulsing OSL curve that\r\n    can be used to test the function `fit_OSLLifeTimes()`.\r\n\r\n### Internals\r\n\r\n-   Package news are now provided as markdown document (NEWS.md) which\r\n    is supported by CRAN\r\n-   The package version numbering scheme has been modified to simplify\r\n    the distinction between different developer versions. While relevant\r\n    numbers for CRAN remain X.X.X, which reads `stable.major.minor`\r\n    version, a 4th number indicates the running package build number,\r\n    e.g., 0.9.0.7.\r\n-   New internal function `Luminescence:::.matrix_binning()` to get the\r\n    matrix (and curve) binning consistent; so far used only by the the\r\n    `bin_RLum.Data()` method for `RLum.Data.Spectrum-class`\r\n-   Vignette S4-class object structure updated\r\n-   Internal changes to address changes in R-devel checking logical\r\n    arguments with length more than one (e.g., `if(is.na(x))` returned\r\n    an error if `x` was not a vector of length 1)\r\n-   `src/Makevars` file removed to prevent unconditional stripping in\r\n    response to a recent CRAN request; in return the installation size\r\n    of the package increased in size on some platforms.",
