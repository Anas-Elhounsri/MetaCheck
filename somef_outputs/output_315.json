Please submit them to us! Here's how:\n\n1. Fork the repo. [Some helping info](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks)\n2. Make a new branch. For features/additions base your new branch at `dev`.\n3. Add a test! Only pull requests for documentation and refactoring do not require a test.\n4. Make sure the tests pass. Run `./run_tests.sh` in the top-level directory of the repo.\n5. Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request. Make sure to set the branch to `ucvm:dev`.\n6. Wait for our review. There may be some suggested changes or improvements. Changes can be made after\nthe pull request has been opening by simply adding more commits to your branch.\n\nPull requests can be changed after they are opened, so create a pull request as early as possible.\nThis allows us to provide feedback during development and to answer any questions.\n\nPlease make sure to set the correct branch for your pull request. Also, please do not include large files in your pull request.\nIf you feel that you need to add large files, let us know and we can figure something out.\n\n## Submitting an Issue\n\nPlease open an issue if you want to ask a question about BBP.\n\n* Please search through the past issues to see if your question or the bug has already been addressed\n* Please apply the correct tag to your issue so others can search\n\nIf you want to submit a bug report, please provide the information below:\n* BBP version, Python version, and Platform (Linux, Windows, Mac OSX, etc)\n* How did you install BBP (Docker, from source...)\n* Please provide a short, complete, and correct example that demonstrates the issue.\n* If this broke in a recent update, please tell us when it used to work.\n\n## Additional Resources\n* [Working with Git Forks](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks)\n* [Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)\n* [Docs or it doesn\u2019t exist](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/docs-or-it-doesnt-exist/)\n* Performance Tips:\n  * [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips)\n  * [NumPy and ctypes](https://scipy-cookbook.readthedocs.io/)\n  * [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/docs.html)\n  * [NumPy Book](http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/courses/nlp/Software/NumPyBook.pdf)\n"

Below we outline several of the options:\n1. [BBP Docker Images](https://github.com/sceccode/bbp_docker) Users can run BBP in Docker on their local computers including laptops. Users can install free Docker software on most computers (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows) then run an BBP Docker image in a terminal window on their computer. \n2. [Installation Instructions for Linux Systems:](https://github.com/sceccode/ucvm/wiki) User can install BBP on Linux system. Advanced users that want to install many of the BBP simulation regions and validation events, or that want to run many simultaneous simulations. \n"

Users install the Docker client on their Laptops, and then use the Docker client software to run BBP Docker images. Docker client software is available as a free software download for several operating systems including MacOS, Windows, and Linux.\n\n1. Install Docker Client on User Computer and Start Docker Client\n- Docker Client download from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com)\n- Increase Docker configuration to 2 CPUs and 50GB memory\n\n2. Open a terminal window on your local computer, and create a directory where you will run BBP\n- mkdir /Users/maechlin/bbp_docker\n- cd /Users/maechlin/bbp_docker\n\n3. Create a \"target\" directory where BBP files are input/output\n- cd /Users/maechlin/bbp_docker\n- mkdir target\n- ls /Users/maechlin/bbp_docker/target\n\n4. Open a terminal window and start the BBP Docker image using the docker run command below. The BBP image will be downloaded from Dockerhub. The image is about 80GB so download time may be minutes or longer.\n- docker run --rm -it --mount type=bind,source=\"$(pwd)\"/target,destination=/app/target  sceccode/bbp_19_8_0:211210\n\n5. The images starts and users sees a Linux bash shell command line prompt as user \"bbp\" in directory: /app/target\n \n7. Run a the bbp text-based interface:\n- $run_bbpy.py\n\n8. The files generated by the default validation simulation will be saved to the target directory on the users host computer. Inside the container, the BBP output files are written to /app/target\n\n9. The files written to the /app/target directory are available after the container exits.\n"
