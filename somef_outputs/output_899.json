        "value": "# Installation, configuration and deployment\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\nTo install and run this project, you will need the following components to be installed first:\n\n  * a web server of your choice: we use Apache, thus configuration examples are given for Apache. You may use another server although you shall translate the confifugration appropriately.\n  * PHP 7.1+\n  * Additional PHP packages: `php-mbstring` and `php-xml`, `php-devel`, `php-pear` (PECL)\n  * [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/) (PHP dependency management)\n  * [Corese-KGRAM](https://project.inria.fr/corese/download/) in-memory triple-store and SPARQL endpoint. It is used to store create temporary graphs and evaluate SPARQL queries. Specific features of Corese ([STTL](http://ns.inria.fr/sparql-template/) and [LDScript](http://ns.inria.fr/sparql-extension/)) are also used for the genration of Web pages ([service index and documentation](03-html-doc.md)) and the translation of SPARQL queries into SPIN.\n  * [Java Runtime Environment 10+](https://www.java.com/fr/download/)\n  * a [MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/c) (optional), to serve as the cache database (can be deactivated in [/src/sparqlms/config.ini](../src/sparqlms/config.ini)).\n\n\n#### PHP fine-tuning\n  * Make sure the time zone is defined in the php.ini file, for instance:\n```ini\n  [Date]\n  ; Defines the default timezone used by the date functions\n  ; http://php.net/date.timezone\n  date.timezone = 'Europe/Paris'\n```\n  * To use MongoDB as a cache (optional), install the [MongoDB PHP driver](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/mongodb.installation.manual.php) and add the following line to php.ini:`extension=mongodb.so`\n  * If some SPARQL micro-services require a long time to complete, you may need to increase the default tiemout, for instance:\n```ini\n  [PHP]\n  max_execution_time = 300\n  max_input_time = 300\n```\n  * If some SPARQL micro-services produce large outputs, you may need to increase the default max memory, for instance:\n```ini\n  [PHP]\n  memory_limit = 2048M\n```\n\n  \n## Folders structure\n\n```bash\nsrc/common\n    Cache.php\n    Configuration.php         # management of the config either by config.ini file of service description graph\n    Context.php               # application execution context\n    Metrology.php             # execution time measures\n    Utils.php                 # utility functions\n\nsrc/sparqlms/\n    config.ini                # generic configuration of the SPARQL micro-service engine\n    service.php               # core logics of the SPARQL micro-services\n    resources/                # SPARQL queries used while executing a SPARQL micro-service\n        sms-html-description/ # STTL transformation generating an HTML page from a service description graph\n\nservices/                     # directory where the services are deployed\n    <Web API>/                # directory of the services related to one Web API\n    \n        # Service with arguments passed as parameters of the HTTP query string\n        <service>/\n            config.ini        # micro-service configuration\n            profile.jsonld    # JSON-LD profile to translate the JSON response into JSON-LD\n            construct.sparql  # optional SPARQL CONSTRUCT query to create triples that JSON-LD cannot create\n            service.php       # optional script to perform specific actions (see folder 'manual_config_example')\n                              \n        # Service with arguments passed in the SPARQL query graph pattern\n        <service>/\n            profile.jsonld    # JSON-LD profile to translate the JSON response into JSON-LD\n            construct.sparql  # optional SPARQL CONSTRUCT query to create triples that JSON-LD cannot create\n            service.php       # optional script to perform specific actions (see folder 'manual_config_example')\n            ServiceDescription.ttl # SPARQL Service Description describing this micro-service\n            ShapesGraph.ttl   # optional SHACL description of the graphs produced by the service\n        ...\n        \ndeployment/\n    docker/                   # this folder gives the necessary files to build Corese and your SPARQL micro-services as Docker containers\n    apache/                   # Apache rewriting rules for HTTP access\n    corese/                   # Corese configuration and running files\n    deploy.sh                 # customization of services' configuration files and SPARQL queries\n```\n\n## Installation procedure\n\nClone this Github repository to a directory that is made accessible through HTTP by Apache, typically `/var/www/html/sparqlms` or `~/public_html/sparqlms` in your home directory.\n\nCD to sparqlms directory.\n\nUse composer to [install the dependencies](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#installing-dependencies), this will create a `vendor` directory with the required PHP libraries:\n```\ncomposer install\n```\n\nCreate directory `logs` with execution and modification rights for all (`chmod 777 logs`), so that Apache can write into it.\n\nYou should now have the following directory structure:\n\n```\nservices/\nsparqlms/\n    deployment/\n    logs/\n    src/\n        common/\n        sparqlms/\n    vendor/\n```\n\n### Customize the properties in file [/src/sparqlms/config.ini](../src/sparqlms/config.ini):\n\n- Set the URL of your write-enabled SPARQL endpoint and optional SPARQL-to-SPIN service. These do not need to be exposed on the internet, only the Apache process should have access to them, e.g.:\n```\nsparql_endpoint = http://localhost:8081/sparql\nspin_endpoint   = http://localhost:8081/service/sparql-to-spin\n```\n- Set the path to the directories where SPARQL micro-services are deployed, e.g.:\n```\nservices_paths[] = ../../services\nservices_paths[] = /home/user/services\n```\n- The MongoDB cache is activated by default. If you don't want to use it, turn it off:\n```\nuse_cache = false\n```\n\n\n## Customize the SPARQL micro-services' configuration\n\nThe services provided in folder [/services](../services) are configured as if they were deployed at http://example.org/service, and the dereferenceable URIs they generate are in the form http://example.org/ld. These must be customized before you can use the services, to match the URL at which they are deployed.\n\nAlso, services requiring an API KEY need to be updated with your own private API keys.\n\nScript [/deployment/deploy.sh](../deployment/deploy.sh) does that for you: copy the script to the folder where the services are located (for instance /services), update the variables `SERVER`, `SERVERPATH`, `SMSDIR` and `API_KEY`, and run the script.\n\n\n### Change the log level\n\nThe application writes log traces in files named like `logs/sms-<date>.log`. The default log level is NOTICE. To change it, simply update the following line in [/src/sparqlms/config.ini](../src/sparqlms/config.ini) with e.g. INFO or DEBUG:\n\n```\n    log_level = INFO\n```\n\nLog levels are described in [Monolog documentation](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/master/doc/01-usage.md#log-levels).\n\n\n### Corese-KGRAM security configuration\n\nStarting version 4.1.6, Corese-KGRAM implements some [security measures](https://files.inria.fr/corese/doc/level.html) that require defining explicitely the HTTP domains where Corese-KGRAM is allowed to look for remote ressources. \nThis applies to SPARQL federated queries (clause SERVICE <...>), but also to STTL transformation files (that can no longer be accessed directly from the local file system).\n\nTo allow those case:\n  * in the [Corese profile](../deployment/corese/corese-profile-sms.ttl), complete the list of URLs of all the domains that SERVICE clauses are allowed to reach:\n```\n  st:access st:namespace\n    <http://localhost/sttl>,\n    <https://sparql-micro-services.org>,\n    <http://sms.i3s.unice.fr/sparql-ms>.\n```\n  * In the Apache configuration, create aliases to expose the STTL folders through http://localhost/sttl/. File [/deployment/apache/example.org.conf](../deployment/apache/example.org.conf) provides an example Apache configuration to do that.\n\n\nNote: You may deactivate those security constraints by using the \"-su\" option of Corese. But this opens a potential security leak, e.g. a SPARQL query submitted to a SPARQL micro-serivce may execute SERVICE clauses against any endpoint.\n\n\n### URL rewriting rules\n\nYou now need to configure [rewriting rules](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/) so that Apache will route SPARQL micro-service invocations appropriately. Several rules are needed to deal with the regular invocation with a SPARQL query, or the invocation to dereference URIs.\nComplete examples are given in [/deployment/apache/example.org.conf](../deployment/apache/example.org.conf), and the sections below provide further explanations.\n\nThe main entry point of SPARQL micro-services is the [service.php](../src/sparqlms/service.php) script. This script takes several parameters listed in the table below:\n\nParameter | Description\n--------- | -------------\nservice | the name of SPARQL micro-service being invoked, formatted as `<Web API>/<service>`\nquerymode | either `sparql` for regular SPARQL invocation or `ld` when the service is invoked to dereference a URI\nroot_url | URL at which the SPARQL micro-service is deployed (optional). If provided, this parameter overrides the `root_url` parameter in the [main config.ini](../src/sparqlms/config.ini) file.\nquery, default-graph-uri, named-graph-uri | the regular SPARQL parameters described in the [SPARQL Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-protocol-20130321/) (since a SPARQL micro-service is first of all a SPARQL endpoint). When the service is invoked for URI dereferencing (querymode=ld), these parameters are ignored.\n*service custom arguments* | any other arguments of the SPARQL micro-service in case they are passed as query string parameters\n\nApache rewriting rules are used to route invocations to `service.php` while setting the `querymode`, `service` and `root_url` parameters appropriately. Other parameters (`query`, `default-graph-uri`, `named-graph-uri` and the service custom arguments) that are passed by the client invoking the service are transmitted transparantly to `service.php`.\n\n\n#### Rewriting rules for SPARQL querying\n\nIf the service custom arguments are passed on the HTTP query string ([config.ini method](02-config.md#configuration-with-file-configini)), the URL pattern is a follows:\n```http://example.org/service/<Web API>/<service>?param=value```.\n\nIf they are passed passed within the SPARQL query graph pattern ([Service Description method](02-config.md#configuration-with-a-sparql-service-description-file)), the URL pattern is simply:\n```http://example.org/service/<Web API>/<service>```.\n\nThe rewriting rule below invokes script  `service.php` with parameter `querymode` set to `sparql` and `service` set to `<Web API>/<service>`.\nThe other parameters (`query`, `default-graph-uri`, `named-graph-uri` and the service custom arguments) are passed transparently (flag QSA of the rewriting rule):\n```\n    RewriteRule \"^/service/([^/?]+)/([^/?]+).*$\" http://example.org/~userdir/sparqlms/src/sparqlms/service.php?querymode=sparql&service=$1/$2 [QSA,P,L]\n```\n\n**Example**. The following invocation:\n```sparql\nSELECT * WHERE {\n  SERVICE <https://example.org/service/macaulaylibrary/getAudioByTaxon?name=Delphinus+delphis>\n  { [] <http://schema.org/contentUrl> ?audioUrl. }\n}\n```\nwill be rewritten into this URL:\n```\nhttp://example.org/~userdir/sparqlms/src/sparqlms/service.php?querymode=sparql&service=macaulaylibrary/getAudioByTaxon&name=Delphinus+delphis\n```\n\n\n#### Rewriting rules for URI dereferencing\n\nHere we describe the example of the Flickr Web API.\n\nService `flickr/getPhotosByTaxon_sd` generates RDF triples with photo URIs formatted as follows:\n`http://example.org/ld/flickr/photo/<identifier>`, where `<identifier>` is the Flickr internal identifier.\n\nTo produce a graph in response to the lookup of such a URI, service `flickr/getPhotoById` is used. The rewriting rule below invokes script  `service.php` with parameter `querymode` set to `ld` and `service` set to `flickr/getPhotoById`:\n\n    RewriteRule \"^/ld/flickr/photo/(.*)$\" http://example.org/~userdir/sparqlms/src/sparqlms/service.php?querymode=ld&service=flickr/getPhotoById&photo_id=$1 [P,L]\n```\n```\n\nThis invokes service `flickr/getPhotoById` with the `photo_id` parameter whose value is extract from the URI.\n\nNote that the `querymode=ld` argument instructs `service.php ` to execute the query in file `construct.sparql` and return the response of this query as the response to the URI lookup query. Hence no SPARQL `query` argument needs to be provided.\n\n**Example**. The following invocation:\n```\n    curl --header \"Accept:text/turtle\" http://example.org/ld/flickr/photo/31173091516\n```\nwill be rewritten into this URL:\n```\nhttp://example.org/~userdir/sparqlms/src/sparqlms/service.php?querymode=ld&service=flickr/getPhotoById&photo_id=31173091516\n```\n\n\n#### Rewriting rules for dereferencing ServiceDescription and SHACL graphs\n\nAdditional rewrinting rules must be set to allow dereferencing the ServiceDescription and SHACL graphs, as well as the translation of the ServiceDescription graph into an HTML page.\n\nComplete examples are given in the first part of the [/deployment/apache/example.org.conf](../deployment/apache/example.org.conf).\n\n\n# Start the services\n\nIf some SPARQL micro-services are [configured with a Service Description file](02-config.md#configuration-with-a-sparql-service-description-file), then files ServiceDescription.ttl, ServiceDescriptionPrivate.ttl and ShapesGraph.ttl of each SPARQL micro-service must be loaded as named graphs when Corese-KGRAM starts.\nScript [corese-server.sh](../deployment/corese/corese-server.sh) prepares a list of those files as well as their named graphs URIs, then it starts up Corese-KGRAM that immediately loads the files.\n\n\nUpdate this script as needed and run it:\n\n`./corese-server.sh`\n\nIf you are using MongoDB as a cache database, make sure it is running:\n\n`sudo systemctl status mongod`\n\nFInally, restart the Apache server to take into account any configuration changes:\n\n`sudo systemctl status httpd`\n\n\n\n# Test the installation\n\n## Test SPARQL querying\n\nYou can test the services using the commands below in a bash.\n\n```bash\nSERVICEPATH=http://localhost/service\n\n# URL-encoded query: select * where {?s ?p ?o}\nSELECT='select%20*%20where%20%7B%3Fs%20%3Fp%20%3Fo%7D'\n\ncurl --header \"Accept: application/sparql-results+json\" \\\n  \"${SERVICEPATH}/flickr/getPhotoById?query=${SELECT}&photo_id=31173091246\"\n\ncurl --header \"Accept: application/sparql-results+json\" \\\n  \"${SERVICEPATH}/musicbrainz/getSongByName?query=${SELECT}&name=Delphinus+delphis\"\n```\n\nThat should return a SPARQL JSON result.\n\n## Test URI dereferencing\n\nEnter this URL in your browser: http://localhost/ld/flickr/photo/31173091246 or the following command in a bash:\n\n```bash\ncurl --header \"Accept: text/turtle\" http://localhost/ld/flickr/photo/31173091246\n```\n\nThis should return an RDF description of the photographic resource similar to:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/> .\n@prefix cos: <http://www.inria.fr/acacia/corese#> .\n@prefix dce: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix sd: <http://www.w3.org/ns/sparql-service-description#> .\n@prefix ma: <http://www.w3.org/ns/ma-ont#> .\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n\n<http://localhost/ld/flickr/photo/31173091516>\n    rdf:type schema:Photograph ;\n    dce:title           \"Delphinus delphis 1 (13-7-16 San Diego)\" ;\n    schema:author       <https://flickr.com/photos/10770266@N04> ;\n    schema:subjectOf    <https://www.flickr.com/photos/10770266@N04/31173091516/> ;\n    schema:thumbnailUrl <https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5567/31173091516_f1c09fa5d5_q.jpg> ;\n    schema:image        <https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5567/31173091516_f1c09fa5d5_z.jpg> .\n```\n\n## Test the HTML documentation generation\n\nTwo services are provided with a service description graph that can be dynamically translated into an HTML documentation. Enter the following URLs in a web browser:\n```\nhttp://localhost/service/flickr/getPhotosByTags_sd/\n```\n\nYou can also look up the URIs of the service description and shapes graphs directly, e.g.:\n```\ncurl --header \"Accept: text/turtle\" http://localhost/service/flickr/getPhotosByTags_sd/ServiceDescription\ncurl --header \"Accept: text/turtle\" http://localhost/service/flickr/getPhotosByTags_sd/ShapesGraph\n```\n"
