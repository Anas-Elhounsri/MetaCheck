If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"macSands/templateB3\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the templateB3 project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to this\nproject you agree to abide by its terms.\n"

Whether comparing communities across landscapes, examining functional distances between species, or assessing environmental contrasts, dissimilarity metrics underpin analyses of diversity, turnover, and ecological change. However, these metrics are often scattered across packages, calculated inconsistently, or tailored to a single data type (e.g., species composition only).\n\n**`dissmapr`** provides a unified, transparent, and reproducible framework for calculating and analysing dissimilarities across **communities**, **traits**, and **environments**. By bringing these components together, the package helps ecologists explore how biodiversity varies in space and time, and how functional and environmental contexts shape these patterns.\n\nThe package goes beyond simple pairwise distances, offering tools to:\n\n* Partition dissimilarity into interpretable components such as **turnover** and **nestedness**.\n* Directly map dissimilarity values to geographic or environmental space, enabling spatially explicit analyses.\n* Compare metrics across data types, fostering integrated biodiversity assessments.\n\nBy combining flexible metric choice with consistent data handling and mapping functions, `dissmapr` is designed to streamline biodiversity workflows, support cross-study comparability, and provide decision-relevant outputs for conservation and global change research.\n\n---\n"
