If you\u2019ve found a\nbug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal \n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  \n*  Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.\nThe `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used\nby the package.  \n*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).\nYou can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to\napply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with \nyour PR.  \n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with\n[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html), \nfor documentation.  \n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions\nwith test cases included are easier to accept.  \n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the\ncurrent development version header describing the changes made followed by your\nGitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the capybara project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html).

It works with larger datasets as well and facilites\ncomputing clustered standard errors. \n\u2018capybara\u2019 is a fast and small footprint software that provides\nefficient functions for demeaning variables before conducting a GLM\nestimation. This technique is particularly useful when estimating linear\nmodels with multiple group fixed effects. It is a fork of the excellent\nAlpaca package created and maintained by [Dr.\u00a0Amrei\nStammann](https://github.com/amrei-stammann). The software can estimate\nExponential Family models (e.g., Poisson) and Negative Binomial models. \nTraditional QR estimation can be unfeasible due to additional memory\nrequirements. The method, which is based on Halperin (1962) vector\nprojections offers important time and memory savings without\ncompromising numerical stability in the estimation process. \nThe software heavily borrows from Gaure (2013) and Stammann (2018) works\non OLS and GLM estimation with large fixed effects implemented in the\n\u2018lfe\u2019 and \u2018alpaca\u2019 packages.
