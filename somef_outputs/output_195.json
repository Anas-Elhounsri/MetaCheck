Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project contributors.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nIf a contributor engages in harassing behaviour, the project organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from online forums, online project resources, face-to-face meetings, or any other project-related activity or resource.\n\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the project team immediately.  Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team.
