Your actual NLP application is treated as a black box,\nof which only the parameters, input formats and output formats need to be\ndescribed. Your application itself needs not be network aware in any way, nor\naware of CLAM, and the handling and validation of input can be taken care of by\nCLAM. \nCLAM is entirely written in Python, runs on UNIX-derived systems, and is\navailable as open source under the GNU Public License (v3). It is set up in a\nmodular fashion, and offers an API, and as such is easily extendable. CLAM\ncommunicates in a transparent XML format, and using XSL transformation offers a\nmodern client-side generated web-interface for human end users. \n"

        "value": "Installation from the Python Package Index using the  package manager *pip* it the recommended way to\nintall CLAM. This is the easiest method\nof installing CLAM, as it will automatically fetch and install any\ndependencies. We recommend to use a virtual environment (``virtualenv``) if you\nwant to install CLAM locally as a user, if you want to install globally,\nprepend the following commands with ``sudo``:\n\nCLAM can be installed from the Python Package Index using pip. Pip is usually\npart of the ``python3-pip`` package (Debian/Ubuntu) or similar, note that\nPython 2.7 is not supported anymore (you might need to call ``pip3`` instead of ``pip`` on older system). It downloads CLAM and all dependencies\nautomatically:::\n\n  $ pip install clam\n\nIf you already downloaded CLAM manually (from github), you can do::\n\n  $ pip install .\n\nIf pip is not yet installed on your system, install it using:\n on debian-based linux systems (including Ubuntu)::\n\n  $ apt-get install python3-pip\n\non RPM-based linux systems::\n\n  $ yum install python3-pip\n\nNote that sudo/root access is needed to install globally. Ask your system administrator\nto install it if you do not own the system. Alternatively, you can install it locally in a Python virtual\nenvironment::\n\n  $ virtualenv --python=python3 env\n\nOr::\n\n  $ python3 -m venv env\n\nThen activate it as follows:\n\n  $ . env/bin/activate\n\n  (env)$ pip install clam\n\nCLAM also has some optional dependencies. For MySQL support, install\n``mysqlclient`` using pip. For `FoLiA <https://proycon.github.io/folia>`_\nsupport, install ``FoLiA-Tools`` using pip.\n\n**Note:** CLAM is designed for Linux-like systems, although the client and data library work everywhere, hosting webservices via ``clamservice`` may not work on Windows.\n\nRunning a test webservice\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you installed CLAM using the above method, then you can launch a clam test\nwebservice using the development server as follows::\n\n  $ clamservice -H localhost -p 8080 clam.config.textstats\n\nNavigate your browser to http://localhost:8080 and verify everything works\n\n**Note:** It is important to regularly keep CLAM up to date as fixes and\nimprovements are implemented on a regular basis. Update CLAM using::\n\n  $ pip install -U clam\n\n\n"
