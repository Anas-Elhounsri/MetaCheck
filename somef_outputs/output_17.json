Feel free to email me or write soemthing in github. If you want `icd` to work differently, or do new things, then the best way is to file a [github issue](https://github.com/jackwasey/icd/issues): there are probably others who have the same or similar needs, and they, or I, may have already thought about them.\n\nA substantial amount of code has now been contributed to the package. Contributions of any kind to `icd` are very welcome. See the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/jackwasey/icd/issues) to see open issues and feature requests. Documentation, vignettes and examples are very welcome, especially if accompanied by real-world data.\n\nTo build `icd`, `Rcpp` must be compiled from source. This happens automatically on Linux, but on Mac and Windows, the following may sometimes be required, especially after upgrading R itself. This is a limitation of the R build system.\n\n```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}\ninstall.packages(\"Rcpp\", type = \"source\")\n```\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you find that an ICD code doesn't give the comorbidity or description you expect, this is an issue! If some code runs too slowly to be useful, this is also an issue. As people run more and more real world data through `icd`, more problems will undoubtedly pop up, and may be trivial to fix, so please share these experiences with other users by making [github issues](https://github.com/jackwasey/icd/issues).\n\nThe [github issues](https://github.com/jackwasey/icd/issues) also sketch out future plans and suggestions for the package.\n\n## Coding standards\n\nContributions should follow the coding standard seen elsewhere in the package, which is defined by both the [general recommendations](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) of Hadley Wickham, and the `.lintr` file in the project root directory. I'd prefer that [new dependencies](http://www.tinyverse.org) aren't included unless absolutely necessary.\n\n## Testing\n\nNew user-facing code should be covered by the test suite. Code which generates data off-line for inclusion in the package ideally has some unit tests on the code itself, or its output data.\n\n## Security vulnerabilities\n\nIn the unlikely event of a security vulnerability, which is not due to R itself, please email me directly and do not file a github issue immediately.\n\nThanks!\n\nJack Wasey\n"

        "description": "Perhaps it is an obsession, but for reproducible research, I think it is important to extract data from source wherever possible. ICD-9-CM code definitions are scattered between very old formal documents, text files (with no hierarchical information) and a monstrous RTF document with everything on it. The RTF is not in any way designed to be machine readable for anything other than display, but, with difficulty, can be parsed to get the data.\n\nThis version derives ICD-9 codes from the RTF and plain text sources. Previously, `icd9` relied on scraping some heading data from an unofficial web site. For the end user, this means greater fidelity to the actual specification (which changes annually), and improved processing of ICD-9 code ranges, e.g. finding parent codes common to a subset of codes in a list, and thus enabling summaries of otherwise complicated lists.\n\nThe OpenMP parallelization and C++11 optimization are now working to the satisfaction of CRAN (and Solaris and OS X compilers), using a configure script which builds the right `Makevars` each installation. I haven't benchmarked `-O3` compiler flag, but this is likely to give a boost.\n\nOther changes and many small improvements and bug fixes are listed in NEWS.md and the git log.\n",
