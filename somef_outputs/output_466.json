Before making changes make sure to pull changes in from upstream by doing either `git fetch upstream` then merge later or `git pull upstream` to fetch and merge in one step\n* Make your changes (bonus points for making changes on a new feature branch)\n* Please do write a test(s) for your changes if they affect code and not just docs\n* Push up to your account\n* Submit a pull request to home base at `ropensci/rnoaa`\n\nNote: Continuous integration checks may fail because secret tokens for the NCDC API are not available in PR's. Don't worry about these failures UNLESS they are clearly due to code in your PR.\n\n### Also, check out our [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org)\n\n### Email\n\nDo not email. Open an issue.\n"

This is useful when you\n  use `isd()` but need to read the file in later when it's already cached.\n  (#169)\n- Some functions in `rnoaa` cache files that are downloaded from\n  various NOAA web services. File caching is usually done when data comes\n  from FTP servers. In some of these functions where we cache data, we used\n  to write to your home directory, but have now changed all these functions\n  to write to a proper cache directory in a platform independent way.\n  We determine the cache directory using `rappdirs::user_cache_dir()`.\n  Note that this may change your workflow if you'd been depending on\n  cached files to be a in particular place on your file system. In addition,\n  the `path` parameter in the changed functions is now defunct, but you\n  get an informative warning about it (#171)\n\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n- `storm_data()` now returns a tibble/data.frame not inside of a list. We used\n  to return a list with a single slot `data` with a data.frame, but this was\n  unnecessary.\n- `ghcnd_stations()` now outputs a data.frame (`tbl_df`) by itself,\n  instead of a data.frame nested in a list. This may change how\n  you access data from this function. (#163)\n- Improved docs on token usage for NCDC functions (with prefix\n  `ncdc_*()`) (#167)\n- Added note to `isd()` docs that when you get an error similar to\n  `Error: download failed for ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/1955/011490-99999-1955.gz`,\n  the file does not exist on NOAA's ftp servers.

        "description": "### NEW FEATURES\n- A large PR was merged with a suite of functions. Most functions added \n  a prefixed with `meteo_*`, and are meant to find weather monitors near \n  locations (`meteo_nearby_stations`), find all monitors within a radius \n  of a location (`meteo_distance`), calculate the distances between a \n  location and all available stations (`meteo_process_geographic_data`),  \n  calculate the distance between two locations (`meteo_spherical_distance`),\n  pull GHCND weather data for multiple weather monitors (`meteo_pull_monitors`), \n  create a tidy GHCND dataset from a single monitor (`meteo_tidy_ghcnd`), \n  and determine the \"coverage\" for a station data frame (`meteo_coverage()`). \n  In addition, `vis_miss()` added to visualize missingness in a data.frame. See \n  the [PR diff against master](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa/pull/159/files)\n  for all the changes. (#159) Thanks a ton to @geanders _et al_. (@hrbrmstr, \n  @masalmon, @jdunic, @njtierney, @leighseverson, @RyanGan, @mandilin, @jferreri, \n  @cpatrizio88, @ryan-hicks, @Ewen2015, @mgutilla, @hakessler, @rodlammers)\n\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n- `isd_stations_search()` changed internal structure. We replaced \n  usage of `geojsonio` and `lawn` for faster `dplyr::filter` for \n  bbox inputs, and `meteo_distance()` for `lat/long/radius` inputs\n  . This speeds up this function significantly. Thanks to @lukas-rokka \n  (#157)\n- `isd_stations_search()` and `isd_stations()` now return \n  tibble's instead of data.frame's\n- Removed cached ISD stations dataset within package to reduce\n  package size. Only change is now that on first use of the function\n  the user has to download the entire thing, but on subsquent \n  uses it will pull from the cached version on the users machine. \n  `isd_stations_search()` now caches using `rappdirs` (#161)\n- Convert all `is()` uses to `inherits()`\n\n### BUG FIXES\n- Fixed `seaiceeurls()` function that's used to generate urls for \n  the `seaice()` function - due to change in NOAA urls (#160)\n- Fix to function `ghncd_split_vars()` to not fail on `dplyr::contains` \n  call (#156) thanks @lawinslow !\n",

All `noaa*()` functions for NCDC data changed to `ncdc*()`. `noaa_buoy()` changed to `buoy()`. `noaa_seaice()` changed to `seaice()`. When you call the old versions an error is thrown, with a message pointing you to the new function name. See ?rnoaa-defunct.\n- New vignettes: NCDC attributes, NCDC workflow, Seaice vignette, SWDI vignette, ERDDAP vignette, NOAA buoy vignette.\n- New functions to interact with NOAA ERDDAP data: `erddap_info()`, `erddap_data()`, and `erddap_search()`.\n- New functions to interact with NOAA buoy data: `buoy()`, including a number of helper functions.\n- `ncdc()` now splits apart attributes. Previously, the attributes were returned as a single column, but now there is column for each attribute so data can be easily retrieved. Attribute columns differ for each different `datasetid`.\n- `buoy()` function has been removed from the CRAN version of `rnoaa`. Install the version with `buoy()` and associated functions via `devtools::install_github(\"ropensci/rnoaa\", ref=\"buoy\")`\n\n## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n- `noaa_swdi()` (function changed to `swdi()`) gains new parameter `filepath` to specify path to write a file to if `format=kmz` or `format=shp`. Examples added for using `format=` csv, shp, and kmz.\n- Now using internal version of `plyr::compact`.\n- Added API response checker/handler to all functions to pass on helpful messages on server errors.\n- `ncdc()` gains new parameter `includemetadata`. If TRUE, includes metadata, if not, does not, and response should be faster as does not take time to calculate metadata.\n- `noaa_stations()` gains new parameter `radius`. If `extent` is a vector of length 4 (for a bounding box) then radius is ignored, but if you pass in two points to `extent`, it is interpreted as a point, and then `radius` is used as the distance upon which to construct a bounding box. `radius` default is 10 km.\n\n## BUG FIXES\n- `datasetid`, `startdate`, and `enddate` are often required parameters, and changes were made to help users with this.\n",
