If you want to know more about why and how to contribute to open source projects like this one, see this [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).\n\n### Share the love \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThink genedroppeR is useful? Let others discover it, by telling them in person, via Twitter or a blog post.\n\nUsing genedroppeR for a paper you are writing? Consider [citing it][citation].\n\n### Ask a question \u2049\ufe0f\n\nUsing genedroppeR and got stuck? Browse the [documentation][http://github.com/susjoh/genedroppeR] to see if you can find a solution. Still stuck? Post your question as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we cannot offer user support, we'll try to do our best to address it, as questions often lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.\n\nWant to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer by [email][mailto:Susan.Johnston@ed.ac.uk].\n\n### Propose an idea \ud83d\udca1\n\nHave an idea for a new our_package feature? Take a look at the [documentation][http://github.com/susjoh/genedroppeR] and [issue list][issues] to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:\n  \n* Explain in detail how it would work.\n* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.\n\nSee below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.\n\n### Report a bug \ud83d\udc1b\n\nUsing our_package and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:\n  \n* Your operating system name and version (e.g. Mac OS 10.13.6).\n* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.\n* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.\n\n### Improve the documentation \ud83d\udcd6\n\nNoticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!\n  \n\n#### Function documentation\n\nFunctions are described as comments near their code and translated to documentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/). If you want to improve a function description:\n\n1. Go to `R/` directory in the [code repository][repo].\n2. Look for the file with the name of the function.\n3. [Propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with `#'`).\n\n### Contribute code \ud83d\udcdd\n\nCare to fix bugs or implement new functionality for our_package? Awesome! \ud83d\udc4f Have a look at the [issue list][issues] and leave a comment on the things you want to work on. See also the development guidelines below.\n\n## Development guidelines\n\nWe try to follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.\n\n1. Fork [this repo][repo] and clone it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).\n2. If you have forked and cloned the project before and it has been a while since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/) to your clone by using `git pull upstream master`.\n3. Open the RStudio project file (`.Rproj`).\n4. Make your changes:\n  * Write your code.\n* Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).\n* Document your code (see function documentation above).\n* Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors and warnings.\n5. Commit and push your changes.\n6. Submit a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).\n"

A founder is defined as an individual where neither the mother or father is known. The frequency of the A allele, which confers a larger horn, seems to be increasing in the population: \nHowever, given the complex structure of the pedigree, it may be that this increase in allele frequency is more likely to be due to drift than selection. One approach to model this is to simulate allele frequency changes given a pedigree of the same structure, and see if the observed allele frequency change is significantly different from what we would expect by chance. This is the motivation for conducting a \"genedrop\" analysis, where we can model this based on the observed pedigree structure.\n \n"

To run the genedrop, we select some cohorts at the start to be the \"founder\" cohorts, where allele frequencies are sampled from the observed frequencies in each year. In Figure 3, the number of cohorts declines rapidly until around 5 cohorts (1989 - 1993), so lets define the first 4 cohorts as founder cohorts, and the rest as simulated cohorts i.e. we will investigate how allele frequencies change in the second 26 year period from 1993 to 2018.\n\nAs *Horns* is a biallelic locus, we use the function `genedrop_snp()`. We define the `id`, `mother`, `father`, `cohort` and `genotype` using columns from the `unicorn` dataset. We then define `nsim`, the number of simulations to run and the number of founder cohorts. We can also select `fix_founders` which keeps the founder genotypes fixed in genotyped individuals, i.e. how allele frequencies would change from an almost identical starting point.\n\n```         \ngenedrop_obj <- genedrop_snp(\n   id = unicorn$id,\n   mother = unicorn$mother,\n   father = unicorn$father,\n   cohort = unicorn$cohort,\n   genotype = unicorn$Horns,\n   nsim = 1000,\n   n_founder_cohorts = 4,\n   fix_founders = TRUE)\n```\n\nWe can then get the summary results by running:\n\n```         \nsummary_genedrop(genedrop_obj)\n\n> summary_genedrop(genedrop_obj)\n\n*** Summary: genedroppeR analysis ***\n\nModel parameters: cohorts = 30, Simulations = 1000, Founder cohorts = 4.\nFounder genotypes fixed, Offspring not resampled.\nFounder cohorts have been removed from the below analyses (Default).\n\n            Analysis Allele    Estimate Estimates.Lower Estimates.Higher Simulations\n1  Cumulative Change      p 0.709569448             358              642        1000\n2 Directional Change      p 0.002192312             869              131        1000\n\nplot_genedrop(genedrop_obj)\n```\n\n![Figure 4: Output from `plot_genedrop()`.](tutorial/figs/genedrop_horns.png)\n"
