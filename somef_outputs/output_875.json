To get up and running with the development environment, you will need Postgres installed.  TraitDB can also be configured to work with MySQL if you wish, but Postgres is preferred.\n\n1. Clone the repository\n\n    ```\n    git clone git@github.com:NESCent/TraitDB.git\n    ```\n\n2. Install dependencies with `bundle install`\n3. Set your database credentials as environment variables.  `config/database.yml` will read these values out of the environment.  If your database server is on a different host, set the host/port as well:\n```\nexport TRAITDB_PG_DEV_USER=\"traitdb_dev_user\"\nexport TRAITDB_PG_DEV_PASS=\"your-password-here\"\n```\n4. Run `createuser -d -P traitdb_dev_user` to create this user in your database.\n5. Run `rake db:setup`. It will verify rails can connect to the database and run a `rake db:migrate` to create database tables.  If not successful, you can create the databases and users manually, then run `rake db:migrate` manually.\n6. If you wish to enable Google Sign-in (recommended), you will need to\n    - Register an application for [Google OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)\n    - Enable the Google+ API\n    - Set the Client ID and Client Secret credentials in your environment:\n    ```\n    export TRAITDB_GOOGLE_APP_ID=\"your-google-app-id\"\n    export TRAITDB_GOOGLE_APP_SECRET=\"your-google-app-secret\"\n    ```\n7. Start the server with `rails server`.\n8. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the application.  You will be shown the about page.  If you click _Upload_, you will be redirected to the sign-in screen.  From here, you can sign in with OpenID or a Google Account\n9. Start a [delayed_job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) worker.  Delayed job is used to execute dataset imports as a background process.  It includes a rake task to start a worker.  You can run `rake jobs:work` in an additional terminal process, or run a worker as a daemon with `script/delayed_job start`.\n"

Upgrade this user to an Administrator with the following rake command:\n```\n$ rake traitdb:upgrade_admin[email@domain.com]\nUpgrading email@domain.com\n```\n3. Reload your web browser, you will have an __Admin__ menu option.\n4. Click __Admin->Projects__, and the __New Project__ button.\n5. Fill out the project details and save the new project\n\nAny authenticated user can upload data to any project, but only administrators can create projects and upload Import Configs.\n"

This configuration file will contain the project-specific data for your spreadsheets, as well as allowable values and rules for data relationships and which columns to import, ignore, or convert.\n\nFor detailed information on writing import configs, see the documentation on the [wiki](../../wiki).\n\nExamples for the configuration files are in the [lib/traitdb_import](lib/traitdb_import) directory.\n\nGenerally, the CSV files are required to have the following general characteristics\n\n1. The first row contains column header names\n    The column names include Taxonomic ranks (e.g. Order, Genus, Species), names of traits, and column names for metadata.\n2. Each data row includes trait data and metadata for **one** Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU)\n3. Data for a single trait (column) may be either categorical (One or more string tokens separated by a delimeter) or continuous (floating point values)\n4. Source / Reference information for a trait may be in an associated column\n\nAs an admin user, you can upload and manage Import Configs for a project.  Authenticated users will be able to choose an Import Config when they upload data to the project.\n\nAt the upload stage, the user can get information about the Import Config, or download a template CSV file that conforms to it.\n"
