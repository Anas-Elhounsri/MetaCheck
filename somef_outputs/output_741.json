        "value": "**<Community-name>** Code of Conduct\n\nLike the technical community as a whole, the **<Community-name>** team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.\n\nDiversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.\n\nThis isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.\n\nThis code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the **<Community-name>** project or Governing body. This includes IRC, the mailing lists, the issue tracker, DSF events, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.\n\nIf you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing **<Email-address>**. For more details please see our **<Link-with-reporting-guidelines>**\n\n* Be friendly and patient.\n* Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.\n* Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.\n* Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the **<Community-name>** community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the **<Community-name>** community.\n* Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:\n    * Violent threats or language directed against another person.\n    * Discriminatory jokes and language.\n    * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.\n    * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\n    * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.\n    * Unwelcome sexual attention.\n    * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\n    * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.\n* When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and **<Community name>** is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of **<Community-name>** comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.\n\nOriginal text courtesy of the Speak Up! project.\n\nQuestions?\n\nIf you have questions, please see **<Link-to-faq>**.

It's people like you that make Active Admin such a great tool.\n\n[source: [Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)] **Need more inspiration?** [1] [Read The Docs](http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contribute.html) [2] [Mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/#contributing)\n\n### Tell them why they should read your guidelines.\n\n>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.\n\n[source: [Hoodie](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)]\n\n### Explain what kinds of contributions you are looking for.\n\nKeep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.\n\n> Elasticsearch is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community \u2014 you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Elasticsearch itself.\n\n[source: [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)] **Need more inspiration?** [1] [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/Contributing) [2] [Geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder#known-issues) (\u201cknown issues\u201d)\n\n### Explain contributions you are NOT looking for (if any).\n\nAgain, defining this up front means less work for you. If someone ignores your guide and submits something you don\u2019t want, you can simply close it and point to your policy.\n\n> Please, don't use the issue tracker for [support questions]. Check whether the #pocoo IRC channel on Freenode can help with your issue. If your problem is not strictly Werkzeug or Flask specific, #python is generally more active. Stack Overflow is also worth considering.\n\n[source: [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)] **Need more inspiration?** [1] [cucumber-ruby](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#about-to-create-a-new-github-issue) [2] [Read the Docs](http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/open-source-philosophy.html#unsupported)\n\n# Ground Rules\n### Set expectations for behavior (yours, and theirs).\nThis includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc). Mention and link to your code of conduct, if you have one.\n\n> Responsibilities\n> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.\n> * Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: https://gist.github.com/audreyr/4feef90445b9680475f2\n> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.\n> * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.\n> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.\n> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

This is also a good time to let people know if you follow a label convention for flagging beginner issues.\n\n> Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:\n> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.\n> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.\n> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.\n\n[source: [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#your-first-code-contribution)] **Need more inspiration?** [1] [Read the Docs](http://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contribute.html#contributing-to-development) [2] [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/new-contributors/#first-steps) (scroll down to \"Guidelines\" as well)\n\n### Bonus points: Add a link to a resource for people who have never contributed to open source before.\nHere are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/\n\n> Working on your first Pull Request?

JIRA or Trac), let them know which tools they\u2019ll need to contribute\n\n>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:\n\n>1. Create your own fork of the code\n>2.

As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:\n>* Spelling / grammar fixes\n>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes\n>* Comment clean up\n>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants\n>* Adding logging messages or debugging output\n>* Changes to \u2018metadata\u2019 files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.\n>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another\n\n[source: [Chef](https://github.com/chef/chef/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#chef-obvious-fix-policy)] **Need more inspiration?** [1] [Puppet](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/StandardIssueLabels#standardissuelabels) [2] [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blobmaster/CON(TRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs)  \n\n# How to report a bug\n### Explain security disclosures first!\nAt bare minimum, include this sentence:\n> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue.
