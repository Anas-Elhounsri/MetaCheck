        "description": "# FedData (v2.0.3)\n\nAn _R_ package implementing functions to automate downloading geospatial data available from several federated data sources (mainly sources maintained by the US Federal government). Currently, the package allows for retrieval of five datasets: \n- The [National Elevation Dataset (NED)](http://ned.usgs.gov) digital elevation models (1 and 1/3 arc-second; USGS)\n- The [National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)](http://nhd.usgs.gov) (USGS)\n- The [Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database](http://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/) from the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), which is led by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) under the USDA,\n- The [Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn), coordinated by National Climatic Data Center at NOAA, and\n- The [International Tree Ring Data Bank (ITRDB)](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/tree-ring), coordinated by National Climatic Data Center at NOAA.\n\nAdditional data sources are in the works, including global DEM resources ([ETOPO1](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/global.html), [STRM](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/)), global soils ([HWSD](http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HTML/)), [MODIS](http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov) satellite data products, the [National Atlas](http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/) (US only), [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com), [PRISM](http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu), and [WorldClim](http://www.worldclim.org).\n\nThis package is designed with the large-scale geographic information system (GIS) use-case in mind: cases where the use of dynamic web-services is impractical due to the scale (spatial and/or temporal) of analysis. It functions primarily as a means of downloading tiled or otherwise spatially-defined datasets; additionally, it can preprocess those datasets by extracting data within an area of interest (AoI), defined spatially. It relies heavily on the [**sp**](http://cran.r-project.org/package=sp), [**raster**](http://cran.r-project.org/package=raster), and [**rgdal**](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rgdal) packages.\n\nI recommend [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) for installing _R_ and GDAL:\n\n`brew install gdal --with-complete --with-opencll --with-unsupported --with-libkml --with-python`\n\n(adding the `--HEAD` tag will install the latest development version.)\n\n`brew install r --with-openblas`\n\nRemember, if installing _R_ with Homebrew, you must **completely** remove old _R_ installations, including the _R_ framework, typically installed at `/Library/Frameworks`. This package has been built and tested on a source (Homebrew) install of _R_ on Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite), and has been successfully run on an Ubuntu Linux cluster, and binary installs of _R_ on Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite) and Windows 7.\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install, use the following command in _R_:\n\n`devtools::install_github(\"bocinsky/FedData\")`\n\nSome OS X systems have trouble installing the `rgdal` package from source. If your install fails, and you've installed the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) version of GDAL and _R_, try the following command (from within _R_:\n\n`install.packages(\"rgdal\", configure.args=\"--with-proj-include=/usr/local/include --with-proj-lib=/usr/local/lib\")`\n\nA demo script is available in the `/inst` folder at the location of the installed package.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis package is a product of SKOPE ([Synthesized Knowledge of Past Environments](http://www.envirecon.org)) and the [Village Ecodynamics Project](http://village.anth.wsu.edu).

        "description": "# FedData (v2.0.0)\n\nAn _R_ package implementing functions to automate downloading geospatial data available from several federated data sources (mainly sources maintained by the US Federal government). Currently, the package allows for retrieval of five datasets: \n- The [National Elevation Dataset (NED)](http://ned.usgs.gov) digital elevation models (1 and 1/3 arc-second; USGS)\n- The [National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)](http://nhd.usgs.gov) (USGS)\n- The [Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database](http://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/) from the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), which is led by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) under the USDA,\n- The [Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn), coordinated by National Climatic Data Center at NOAA, and\n- The [International Tree Ring Data Bank (ITRDB)](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/tree-ring), coordinated by National Climatic Data Center at NOAA.\n\nAdditional data sources are in the works, including global DEM resources ([ETOPO1](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/global.html), [STRM](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/)), global soils ([HWSD](http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HTML/)), [MODIS](http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov) satellite data products, the [National Atlas](http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/) (US only), [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com), [PRISM](http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu), and [WorldClim](http://www.worldclim.org).\n\nThis package is designed with the large-scale geographic information system (GIS) use-case in mind: cases where the use of dynamic web-services is impractical due to the scale (spatial and/or temporal) of analysis. It functions primarily as a means of downloading tiled or otherwise spatially-defined datasets; additionally, it can preprocess those datasets by extracting data within an area of interest (AoI), defined spatially. It relies heavily on the [**sp**](http://cran.r-project.org/package=sp), [**raster**](http://cran.r-project.org/package=raster), and [**rgdal**](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rgdal) packages.\n\nI recommend [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) for installing _R_ and GDAL:\n\n`brew install gdal --with-complete --with-opencll --with-unsupported --with-libkml --with-python`\n\n(adding the `--HEAD` tag will install the latest development version.)\n\n`brew install r --with-openblas`\n\nRemember, if installing _R_ with Homebrew, you must **completely** remove old _R_ installations, including the _R_ framework, typically installed at `/Library/Frameworks`. This package has been built and tested on a source (Homebrew) install of _R_ on Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite), and has been successfully run on an Ubuntu Linux cluster, and binary installs of _R_ on Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite) and Windows 7.\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install, use the following command in _R_:\n\n`devtools::install_github(\"bocinsky/FedData\")`\n\nSome OS X systems have trouble installing the `rgdal` package from source. If your install fails, and you've installed the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) version of GDAL and _R_, try the following command (from within _R_:\n\n`install.packages(\"rgdal\", configure.args=\"--with-proj-include=/usr/local/include --with-proj-lib=/usr/local/lib\")`\n\nA demo script is available in the `/inst` folder at the location of the installed package.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis package is a product of SKOPE ([Synthesized Knowledge of Past Environments](http://www.envirecon.org)) and the [Village Ecodynamics Project](http://village.anth.wsu.edu).
