For more detailed\ninfo about contributing to this, and other tidyverse packages, please see the\n[**development contributing guide**](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib).\n\n### Fixing typos\n\nSmall typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using\nthe GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.\n\n*  YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.\n*  NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and\nmake sure someone from the team agrees that it\u2019s a problem. If you\u2019ve found a\nbug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal \n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  \n*  Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.\nThe `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used\nby the package.  \n*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).\nYou can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to\napply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with \nyour PR.  \n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with\n[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html), \nfor documentation.  \n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions\nwith test cases included are easier to accept.  \n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the\ncurrent development version header describing the changes made followed by your\nGitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the virtuoso project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

However, installation can present a few gotchas to users unfamiliar with Virtuoso.  This package seeks to streamline the process of installing, managing, and querying a Virtuoso server.  While the package can be also be used merely to provide a standard `DBI` connection to an RDBS, e.g. as a `dplyr` back-end, Virtuoso's popularity and performance is particularly notable with respect to RDF data and SPARQL queries, so most examples focus on those use cases.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe `virtuoso` package provides installation helpers for both Mac OSX and Windows users through the function `vos_install()`.  At the time of writing, the Mac OS X installer uses Homebrew to install the Virtuoso Open Source server (similar to the `hugo` installer in RStudio's `blogdown`).  On Windows, `vos_install()` downloads and executes the Windows self-extracting archive (`.exe` file), which will open a standard installation dialog in interactive mode, or be run automatically if not run in an interactive session.  No automated installer is provided for Linux systems; Linux users are encouraged to simply install the appropriate binaries for their distribution (e.g. `apt-get install -y virtuoso-opensource` on Debian/Ubuntu systems). \n\n## Configuration\n\nVirtuoso Open Source configuration is controlled by a `virtouso.ini` file, which sets, among other things, which directories can be accessed for tasks such as bulk import, as well as performance tweaks such as available memory.  Unfortunately, the Virtuoso server process (`virtuoso-t` application) cannot start without a path to an appropriate config file, and the installers (e.g. on both Windows and Linux) frequently install an example `virtuoso.ini` to a location which can be hard to find and for which users do not have permission to edit directly. Moreover, the file format is not always intuitive to edit.  The `virtuoso` package thus helps locate this file and provides a helper function, `vos_configure()`, to create and modify this configuration file.  Because reasonable defaults are also provided by this function, users should usually not need to call this function manually.  `vos_configure()` is called automatically from `vos_start()` if the path to a `virtuoso.ini` file is not passed to `vos_start()`.  \n\nIn addition to configuring Virtuoso's settings through a `virtuoso.ini` file, the other common barrier is setting up the driver for the ODBC connection.  Some installers (Mac, Linux) do not automatically add the appropriate driver to an active `odbcinst.ini` file with a predictable Driver Server Name, which we need to know to initiate the ODBC connection.  An internal helper function handles identifying drivers and establishing the appropriate `odcinst.ini` automatically when necessary. \n\n## Server management\n\nLastly, Virtuoso Open Source is often run as a system service, starting when the operating system starts.  This is often undesirable, as the casual laptop user does not want the service running all the time, and can be difficult to control for users unfamiliar with managing such background services on their operating systems.  Instead of this behavior, the `virtuoso` package provides an explicit interface to control the external server. The server only starts when created by `vos_start()`, and ends automatically when the R process ends, or can be killed, paused, or resumed at any time from R (e.g. via `vos_kill()`).  Helper utilities can also query the status and logs of the server from R.  As with most database servers, data persists to disk, at an appropriate location for the OS determined by `rappdirs` package, and a helper utility, `vos_delete_db()` can remove this persistent storage location.  \n\nUsers can also connect directly to any existing (local or remote) Virtuoso instance by passing the appropriate information to `vos_connect()`, which can be convenient for queries.  \n\n\nNote that he Virtuoso back-end provided by the R package `rdflib` can also connect to any Virtuoso server created by the `virtuoso` R package, though queries loading and queries through the `redland` libraries used by `rdflib` will generally be slower than direct calls over ODBC via the `virtuoso` package functions, often dramatically so for large triplestores. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "description": "Virtuoso is a high-performance \"universal server,\" which can act\r\nas both a relational database (supporting standard SQL queries),\r\nand an Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplestore, supporting \r\nSPARQL queries and semantic reasoning. The virtuoso package R provides\r\nR users with a DBI-compatible connection to the Virtuoso database. \r\nThe package also provides helper routines to install, launch, and manage\r\na Virtuoso server locally on Mac, Windows and Linux platforms using\r\nthe standard interactive installers from the R command-line.  By \r\nautomatically handling these setup steps, the package can make Virtuoso\r\nconsiderably faster and easier for a most users to deploy in a local\r\nenvironment. While this can be used as a normal dplyr backend, Virtuoso \r\nexcels when used as a RDF triplestore.  Managing the bulk import of triples\r\nfrom common serializations with a single intuitive command is another key\r\nfeature of the Virtuoso R package.  Bulk import performance can be tens to\r\nhundreds of times faster than the comparable imports using existing R tools,\r\nincluding rdflib and redland packages. \r\n\r\n**initial release for ropensci onboarding**",
