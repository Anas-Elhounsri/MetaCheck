Looks like you are interested in contributing to [PWSpy](https://github.com/nanthony21/PWSpy), which is just great, so welcome!\n  \nWe are open to any kind of contribution: code, documentation, bug-fixing (even just reports), feature-requests and anything else you may come up with.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Discussion\nPlease open an issue on the GitHub page for any discussion.\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Coding\n\nNothing fancy here, just:\n\n1. Fork this repo\n1. Commit you code\n1. Submit a pull request. It will be reviewed by maintainers and they'll give you proper feedback so you can iterate over it.\n\n#### Considerations\n- Make sure existing tests pass\n- Make sure your new code is properly tested and fully-covered\n- Following [The seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) is highly encouraged\n\n\n### Testing\n\nAs mentioned above, existing tests must pass and new features are required to be tested and fully-covered.\n\n### Documenting\n\nCode should be self-documented. But, in case there is any code that may be hard to understand, it must include some comments to make it easier to review and maintain later on.\n"

Any minor variations in how this pre-processing is performed can result in major differences in final analysis results. PWSpy provides an object-oriented interface for performing all common file I/O and analysis tasks related to PWS. This allows users to write succinct and readable scripts/software that function identically regardless of the file format of the raw data and which are guaranteed to perform all basic operations properly. The analysis steps described in previous publications ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5348632/), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09717-6), [3](https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/viewmedia.cfm?uri=ol-45-17-4810&seq=0&html=true)) can be found written out clearly in Python under the `analysis` package. Classes providing uniform file handling for the current file format used by the [PWS Acquisition plugin for Micro-Manager](https://github.com/nanthony21/PWSAcquisition) as well as all known legacy formats can be found under the `dataTypes` package.  This library provides support for the backend code of [PWSpy_GUI](https://github.com/nanthony21/pwspy_gui).\n \n"
