If you connect via the `/api/records/{record_id}` object the files' entries attribute is a map to entries where the filename is used as the key. If you get a list of files using `/api/records/{record_id}/files` the map is replaced with an array. There are additional fields on the Files object (e.g. links object(s)).  The Files type is used now when when encoding/decoding the full record and FileListing is used when working with the structure returned by the \"files\" end point.",
