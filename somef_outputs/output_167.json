        "description": "This is the v2.0.0 release of PyFstat, a python package for gravitational-wave data analysis with the F-statistic, dated 18/04/2023.\r\n\r\nThis release supports python versions from 3.8 to 3.11.\r\n\r\n This is a major release of PyFstat in the sense that users will likely have to make some changes to the way they call it, but mostly just regarding class instance labels / file naming.\r\n\r\nFrom the [changelog](https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat/blob/v2.0.0/CHANGELOG.md):\r\n - Mainly, we follow the recent `lalpulsar` upgrade to v3 of the SFT file format specification (see https://dcc.ligo.org/T040164-v2/public and note the v2 in the URL is not a typo, this file version describes both the v2 and v3 specifications).\r\n   - We now require `lalsuite>=7.13`.\r\n   - The file format update itself is fully backwards compatible: the only change is including window information in the header, which however reuses existing padding bytes, and hence does not affect compatibility.\r\n   - The file naming convention however has become more restrictive: SFT files, and hence `label` arguments for `Writer` and derived classes, now may only contain ASCII alphanumerical characters, which specifically makes the old PyFstat habit of using underscores illegal.  We suggest CamelCase instead.\r\n   - Instead of `SFTWindowBeta`, one must now use `SFTWindowParam`.\r\n   - `noiseSFTs` no longer requires `SFTWindow[Beta/Param]`, only if a window specification cannot be read from the headers of input SFTs.\r\n - Fixed an error that prevented one parameter to be printed in search output file header comments.\r\n - Fixed compatibility with `corner=2.2.2`.\r\n - Removed `utils.get_lal_exec()`, now always expect executables to be named `lalpulsar_`.  (Old LALSuite versions with `lalapps_` CW executables are quite outdated by now.)\r\n - Removed deprecated prior formats in `InjectionParametersGenerator` class.\r\n - Transient F-stat GPU implementation:\r\n   - Introduced F-stat condition number check,  with threshold equivalent to defaults of `XLALComputeAntennaPatternSqrtDeterminant()` and `estimateAntennaPatternConditionNumber()`.\r\n   - Now falls back to F=2 (2F=4) if Ddinv=0, also equivalent to `lalpulsar`.\r\n   - Added unit tests.\r\n   - Improved CUDA device info logging.\r\n - For developers: updated coding style to `black` 23.1.0 rules (mostly newlines policy).\r\n\r\nFor a list of known issues, or to report any problems, please see: https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat/issues",

Please use `pyfstat.set_up_logger` instead to determine verbosity level.\r\n   - tests now by default print all >=WARNING messages even for passing cases and full >=INFO for failing cases\r\n   - improved handling of LALSuite executables through `run_commandline`\r\n     - better stderr/stdout capture\r\n     - return is now either a `subprocess.CompletedProcess` object or `None`\r\n     - default is now `return_output=False`\r\n     - `log_level` argument removed (please use `pyfstat.set_up_logger` instead)\r\n   - capture and handling of output from SWIG-wrapped LALSuite functions likely to be further improved in future versions\r\n - refactored `helper_functions` module into `utils` subpackage with multiple source files;\r\n   - user can access all functions directly as `utils.some_function` without worrying about the level one further down\r\n   - moved `matplotlib` setup into new `utils.safe_X_less_plt()`\r\n   - removed deprecated/unused helper functions:\r\n        - `get_peak_values` \r\n        - `get_comb_values`\r\n        - `get_sft_array`\r\n - can install with `NO_LALSUITE_FROM_PYPI` environment variable, e.g. to avoid duplication of dependencies from conda and pip (now used this way in recommended `pyfstat-dev.yml`)\r\n - removed `peakutils` dependency\r\n - optional `[dev]` set of dependencies now also includes `docs` dependencies\r\n - added `sphinx_autodoc_typehints` to  `docs` dependencies and updated pinned versions of other sphinx packages\r\n - `DetectorStates`: fixed passing plain lists as values of a `timestamps` dict\r\n\r\nFor a list of known issues, or to report any problems, please see: https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat/issues",
