Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time.

However, native support for action spaces where the action _choices_ change for each state is challenging to implement in a computationally efficient fashion. The `graphenv` library provides utility classes that simplify the flattening and masking of action observations for choosing from a set of successor states at every node in a graph search.\n \n"
