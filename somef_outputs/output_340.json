This option provides all the functionality of **ScholarVista**: a CLI tool and the separate Python modules.\n\n2. **The Docker Image**. This option only lets you run the CLI but there is no need for installing the package in your system.\n\n## From Source\n\nTo install **ScholarVista** from source, you can clone the repository and install the package using **_pip_**. When using **_pip_** it is a good practice to use virtual environments. Check out the official documentation on virtual envornments [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).\n\n#### Conda\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mciccale/ScholarVista\ncd ScholarVista\nconda create -n scholarvista-env-3.12 python=3.12\nconda activate scholarvista-env-3.12\npip install .\n```\n\n_Note: You can use **PyEnv** to create a virtual environment. But since **ScholarVista** needs Python >=3.12, it is more suitable to use **Conda**, where you can select the **Python** version to use._\n\n## Docker Container\n\nIf you prefer running **ScholarVista** from a Docker Container, you can build the Docker Image with the following commands.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mciccale/ScholarVista\ncd ScholarVista\ndocker build -t scholarvista-app .\n```\n\nThis will create a Docker Image called **scholarvista-app**. You're free of choosing the name you want for your image.\n\n"

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

See Grobid installation instrucions [here](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Run-Grobid/).\n\nThe most straight-forward way of starting and running **Grobid Service** is by running a _Docker_ image. Make sure you have _Docker_ installed in your system.\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm --init --ulimit core=0 -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.8.0\n```\n\nThis command will run **Grobid** and expose a web client in port 8070.\n\nIf you already have the TEI XML files generated from Grobid saved in a folder, you can directly generate the information from them.\n\n_Note: The TEI XML files **MUST** be obtained using Grobid, as this tool is intended to work only with Grobid generated TEI XML files._\n\n"
