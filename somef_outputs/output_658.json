Urlup uses your operating system's keyring/keychain functionality to ask for and store the credentials.  The first time Urlup needs to get proxy credentials, it will prompt you for the credentials and then store them using your operating system's keyring/keychain functionality, so that it does not have to prompt again in the future.  You can disable the use of the keyring/keychain by running Urlup with the `-X` (or `/X` on Windows) command-line flag.  It is also possible to supply the information directly on the command line using the `-u` and `-p` options (or `/u` and `/p` on Windows), but this is discouraged because it is insecure on multiuser computer systems. \n"

This is often the easiest approach to getting Python on your machine.  If that's not suitable for you for any reason, continue reading!\n\n\n## A note about Python version issues\n\nIt may be possible to use the default copy of Python provided by your operating system if it happens to be a version 3 edition of Python.  As of January 2021, the [oldest still-supported version of Python is 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  However, for historical reasons, many operating system distributions still ship with Python version 2.7 even today. This can be confusing, because the default `python` and `pip` commands provided on these operating systems is version 2.7 of Python; attempting to run programs written for Python version 3 with version 2.7 can result in extremely confusing errors that bear no relationship to the _actual_ problem, which is that the program is not written to run in Python 2.7.\n\n\n## Installing a recent version of Python and `pip`\n\nOn some systems, version 3.x of the Python interpreter and `pip` are available using the commands `python3` and `pip3`, respectively. More often, they must be installed separately.  The following subsections describe how Python 3 can be installed either using the standard software package managers on certain popular operating systems, or using third-party software managers.\n\n\n### Debian/Ubuntu\n\nDebian-based systems still ship with older versions of Python by\ndefault. To install a modern version of Python and the associated version of `pip`, run the following command:\n\n```\nsudo apt install python3 python3-pip\n```\n\n### macOS\n\nThe version of Python that comes with macOS through at least macOS 10.15 (Catalina) is Python 2.7.  The most convenient way to get Python 3.x and the associated version of `pip` is to use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) or [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), depending on your preference.\n\n\n#### _Using MacPorts_\n\nIf you are using macOS and MacPorts, the following command will install a recent version of Python 3:\n\n```\nsudo port install python3 py38-pip\n```\n\nAfter running the command above, you should be able to invoke the Python interpreter using the command `python3`. You can verify the version of Python and `pip` with the following commands:\n\n```\npython3 --version\npython3 -m pip --version\n```\n\n#### _Using HomeBrew_\n\nIf you are using [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), the corresponding commands are as follows:\n\n```\nbrew install python3\n```\n\nHomeBrew's Python 3 package installs `pip3` by default.  Unless you configured your copy of HomeBrew to install it elsewhere, programs should end up in `/usr/local/bin` on your computer.  Look for `pip3` there (e.g., by running the command `ls /usr/local/bin/pip*` to see what gets listed).\n\n\n## Installing Python modules\n\nOften you'll need some additional modules to be installed in your Python development environment, so that you can refer to them in your Python programs using the `import` statement. To make sure you get the desired Python and `pip`, you can use the `-m` interpreter option to install the desired module using a command with the following form:\n\n```shell\npython3 -m pip install MODULENAME\n```\n\nwhere `MODULENAME` is the name of the module you need to install.\n"

For a simple, quick check of a few URLs, you can simply provide the URLs on the command line:\n\n```csh\n# urlup http://sbml.org\nNo output file given -- results won't be saved.\nhttp://sbml.org ==> http://sbml.org/Main_Page [301]\nDone.\n```\n\nThe output produced by `urlup` will consist of a line for each URL given, with the original and final URLs printed along with the HTTP status code received when the original URL is first contacted.  If given the `-e` option (`/e` on Windows), it will also print more details about the meaning of the HTTP status received.  For example:\n\n```csh\n# urlup -e caltech.edu www.caltech.edu\nNo output file specified; results won't be saved.\ncaltech.edu ==> http://www.caltech.edu/\n   [status code 302 = This response code means that the URI of\n   requested resource has been changed temporarily. New changes in the\n   URI might be made in the future. Therefore, this same URI should be\n   used by the client in future requests.]\nwww.caltech.edu ==> http://www.caltech.edu\n   [status code 200 = The request has succeeded.]\n```\n\nThe typical usage for `urlup` is to provide it with a list of URLs in a file (one per line) with the `-i` option (`/i` on Windows), and to tell it to write the results to a CSV file with the `-o` option (`/o` on Windows).\n\n```csh\n# urlup  -i original_urls.txt  -o final_urls.csv\n```\n\nHere is a screen cast to demonstrate.
