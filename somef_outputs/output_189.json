To install the study package (which will build a new R library for you that is specifically for `PioneerWatchfulWaiting`), type the following into a new `R` script and run. You can also retrieve this code from `extras/CodeToRun.R`.\n\n````\n# Prevents errors due to packages being built for other R versions: \nSys.setenv(\"R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS\" = TRUE)\n# \n# First, it probably is best to make sure you are up-to-date on all existing packages.\n# Important: This code is best run in R, not RStudio, as RStudio may have some libraries\n# (like 'rlang') in use.\n#update.packages(ask = \"graphics\")\n\n# When asked to update packages, select '1' ('update all') (could be multiple times)\n# When asked whether to install from source, select 'No' (could be multiple times)\n#install.packages(\"devtools\")\n#devtools::install_github(\"ohdsi-studies/PioneerWatchfulWaiting\", ref=\"v0.4.4\")\n````\nIn [`CodeToRun.R`](extras/CodeToRun.R) you will find a function `verifyDependencies()` which you can use to verify that all dependencies installed correctly.\n\n*Note: When using this installation method it can be difficult to 'retrace' because you will not see the same folders that you see in the GitHub Repo. If you would prefer to have more visibility into the study contents, you may alternatively download the [TAR file](https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/PioneerWatchfulWaiting/archive/master.zip) for this repo and bring this into your `R`/`RStudio` environment. An example of how to call ZIP files into your `R` environment can be found in the [The Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/PopulationLevelEstimation.html#running-the-study-package).*\n\n*Note: if you run into the error `LoadLibrary failure: %1 is not a valid Win32 application` when compiling rJava dependencies, try this instead: *devtools::install_github(\"ohdsi-studies/PioneerWatchfulWaiting\",INSTALL_opts = \"--no-multiarch\").*\n\n*Note: If you are using the `DatabaseConnector` package for the first time, then you may also need to download the JDBC drivers to your database. See the [package documentation](https://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/reference/jdbcDrivers.html), you can do this with a command like `DatabaseConnector::downloadJdbcDrivers(dbms=\"redshift\", pathToDriver=\"/my-home-folder/jdbcdrivers\")`.*\n\n*Note: if you run into 403 errors from Github URLs when installing the package, you may have exceeded your Github API rate limit. If you have a Github account, then you can create a personal access token (PAT) using the link https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,gist&description=R:GITHUB_PAT, and add that to your local environment, for example using `credentials::set_github_pat()` (install the package with `install.packages(\"credentials\")` if you don't have it). The counter should also reset after an hour, so alternatively you can wait for that to happen.*\n\n3. Great work! Now you have set-up your environment and installed the library that will run the package. You can use the following `R` script to load in your library and configure your environment connection details:\n\n```\nlibrary(PioneerWatchfulWaiting)\n\n# Optional: specify where the temporary files (used by the ff package) will be created:\nfftempdir <- if (Sys.getenv(\"FFTEMP_DIR\") == \"\") \"~/fftemp\" else Sys.getenv(\"FFTEMP_DIR\")\noptions(fftempdir = fftempdir)\n\n# Details for connecting to the server:\ndbms = Sys.getenv(\"DBMS\")\nuser <- if (Sys.getenv(\"DB_USER\") == \"\") NULL else Sys.getenv(\"DB_USER\")\npassword <- if (Sys.getenv(\"DB_PASSWORD\") == \"\") NULL else Sys.getenv(\"DB_PASSWORD\")\nserver = Sys.getenv(\"DB_SERVER\")\nport = Sys.getenv(\"DB_PORT\")\nconnectionDetails <- DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails(dbms = dbms,\n                                                                server = server,\n                                                                user = user,\n                                                                password = password,\n                                                                port = port)\n````\n4. You will first need to run the `CohortDiagnostics` package on your entire database. This package is used as a diagnostic to provide transparency into the concept prevalence in your database as it relates to the concept sets and phenotypes we've prepared for the Target, Stratum and Features included in this analysis. We encourage sites to share this information so that we can help design better studies that capture the nuance of your local care delivery and coding practices.\n\n````\n# Run cohort diagnostics -----------------------------------\nrunCohortDiagnostics(connectionDetails = connectionDetails,\n                     cdmDatabaseSchema = cdmDatabaseSchema,\n                     cohortDatabaseSchema = cohortDatabaseSchema,\n                     cohortStagingTable = cohortStagingTable,\n                     oracleTempSchema = oracleTempSchema,\n                     cohortIdsToExcludeFromExecution = cohortIdsToExcludeFromExecution,\n                     exportFolder = outputFolder,\n                     #cohortGroupNames = c(\"target\", \"outcome\", \"strata\"), # Optional - will use all groups by default\n                     databaseId = databaseId,\n                     databaseName = databaseName,\n                     databaseDescription = databaseDescription,\n                     minCellCount = minCellCount)\n````\n\nthis package may take some time to run. This is normal. Allow at least 3 hours for this step. Package runtime will vary based on your infrastructure. We appreciate your patience!\n\nWhen the package is completed, you can view the `CohortDiagnostics` output in a local Shiny viewer:\n````\n# Use the next command to review cohort diagnostics and replace \"target\" with\n# one of these options: \"target\", \"outcome\", \"strata\"\n# CohortDiagnostics::launchDiagnosticsExplorer(file.path(outputFolder, \"diagnostics\", \"target\"))\n````\n\nIf it looks good, you can upload the results to the OHDSI server:\n```\n# For uploading the results. You should have received the key file from the study coordinator, input the correct path here:\nkeyFileName <- \"[key location: e.g. ~/.ssh/study-data-site-pioneer]\"\nuserName <- \"study-data-site-pioneer\" # do not change this, it is linked to the key you have\nuploadDiagnosticsResults(outputFolder, keyFileName, userName)\n```\n\n5. Once you have run `CohortDiagnostics` you are encouraged to reach out to the study leads to review your outputs. \n\n6. You can now run the characterization package. This step is designed to take advantage of incremental building. This means if the job fails, the R package will start back up where it left off. This package has been designed to be computationally efficient. Package runtime will vary based on your infrastructure but it should be significantly faster than your prior CohortDiagnostic run.\n\nIn your `R` script, you will use the following code:\n````\n# Use this to run the study. The results will be stored in a zip file called \n# 'Results_<databaseId>.zip in the outputFolder. \nrunStudy(connectionDetails = connectionDetails,\n         cdmDatabaseSchema = cdmDatabaseSchema,\n         cohortDatabaseSchema = cohortDatabaseSchema,\n         cohortStagingTable = cohortStagingTable,\n         cohortTable = cohortTable,\n         featureSummaryTable = featureSummaryTable,\n         oracleTempSchema = cohortDatabaseSchema,\n         exportFolder = outputFolder,\n         databaseId = databaseId,\n         databaseName = databaseName,\n         databaseDescription = databaseDescription,\n         #cohortGroups = c(\"target\", \"outcome\", \"strata\"), # Optional - will use all groups by default\n         cohortIdsToExcludeFromExecution = cohortIdsToExcludeFromExecution,\n         cohortIdsToExcludeFromResultsExport = cohortIdsToExcludeFromResultsExport,\n         incremental = TRUE,\n         useBulkCharacterization = useBulkCharacterization,\n         minCellCount = minCellCount) \n  ````\n\n7. You can now look at the characterization output in a local Shiny application:\n````\npreMergeResultsFiles(outputFolder)\nlaunchShinyApp(outputFolder)\n````\n\n8. If the study code runs to completion, your outputFolder will have the following contents:\n- RecordKeeping = a folder designed to store incremental information such that if the study code dies, it will restart where it left off\n- cohort.csv: An export of the cohort definitions used in the study. This is simply a cross reference for the other files and does not contain sensitive information.\n- _**cohort_count.csv**_: Contains the list of target and strata cohorts in the study with their counts. The fields `cohort_entries` and cohort_subjects` contain the number of people in the cohort. \n- _**cohort_staging_count.csv**_: Contains a full list of all cohorts produced by the code in the study inclusive of features. The fields `cohort_entries` and cohort_subjects` contain the number of people in the cohort. \n- covariate.csv: A list of features that were identified in the analyzed cohorts. This is a cross reference file with names and does not contain sensitive information.\n- _**covariate_value.csv**_: Contains the statistics produced by the study. The field `mean` will contain the proportion computed. When censored, you will see negative values in this field. \n- database.csv: Contains metadata information that you supplied as part of running the package to identify the database across the OHDSI network. Additionally, the vocabulary version used in your CDM is included.\n- **_feature_proportion.csv_**: This file contains the list of feature proportions calculated through the combination of target/stratified and features. The fields `total_count`,`feature_count`, contain the subject counts for the cohort and feature respectively. The field `mean` contains the proportion of `feature_count/total_count`. \n\nThose files noted in **_bold italics_** above should be reviewed for sensitive information for your site. The package will censor values based on the `minCellCount` parameter specified when calling the `runStudy` function. Censored values will be represented with a negative to show it has been censored. In the case of the fields `cohort_entries` and cohort_subjects`, this will be -5 (where 5=your min cell count specified).

To install the study package (which will build a new R library for you that is specifically for `PioneerWatchfulWaiting`), type the following into a new `R` script and run. You can also retrieve this code from `extras/CodeToRun.R`.\n\n````\n# Prevents errors due to packages being built for other R versions: \nSys.setenv(\"R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS\" = TRUE)\n# \n# First, it probably is best to make sure you are up-to-date on all existing packages.\n# Important: This code is best run in R, not RStudio, as RStudio may have some libraries\n# (like 'rlang') in use.\n#update.packages(ask = \"graphics\")\n\n# When asked to update packages, select '1' ('update all') (could be multiple times)\n# When asked whether to install from source, select 'No' (could be multiple times)\n#install.packages(\"devtools\")\n#devtools::install_github(\"ohdsi-studies/PioneerWatchfulWaiting\", ref=\"v0.4.4\")\n````\nIn [`CodeToRun.R`](extras/CodeToRun.R) you will find a function `verifyDependencies()` which you can use to verify that all dependencies installed correctly.\n\n*Note: When using this installation method it can be difficult to 'retrace' because you will not see the same folders that you see in the GitHub Repo. If you would prefer to have more visibility into the study contents, you may alternatively download the [TAR file](https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/PioneerWatchfulWaiting/archive/master.zip) for this repo and bring this into your `R`/`RStudio` environment. An example of how to call ZIP files into your `R` environment can be found in the [The Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/PopulationLevelEstimation.html#running-the-study-package).*\n\n*Note: if you run into the error `LoadLibrary failure: %1 is not a valid Win32 application` when compiling rJava dependencies, try this instead: *devtools::install_github(\"ohdsi-studies/PioneerWatchfulWaiting\",INSTALL_opts = \"--no-multiarch\").*\n\n*Note: If you are using the `DatabaseConnector` package for the first time, then you may also need to download the JDBC drivers to your database. See the [package documentation](https://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/reference/jdbcDrivers.html), you can do this with a command like `DatabaseConnector::downloadJdbcDrivers(dbms=\"redshift\", pathToDriver=\"/my-home-folder/jdbcdrivers\")`.*\n\n*Note: if you run into 403 errors from Github URLs when installing the package, you may have exceeded your Github API rate limit. If you have a Github account, then you can create a personal access token (PAT) using the link https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,gist&description=R:GITHUB_PAT, and add that to your local environment, for example using `credentials::set_github_pat()` (install the package with `install.packages(\"credentials\")` if you don't have it). The counter should also reset after an hour, so alternatively you can wait for that to happen.*\n\n3. Great work! Now you have set-up your environment and installed the library that will run the package. You can use the following `R` script to load in your library and configure your environment connection details:\n\n```\nlibrary(PioneerWatchfulWaiting)\n\n# Optional: specify where the temporary files (used by the ff package) will be created:\nfftempdir <- if (Sys.getenv(\"FFTEMP_DIR\") == \"\") \"~/fftemp\" else Sys.getenv(\"FFTEMP_DIR\")\noptions(fftempdir = fftempdir)\n\n# Details for connecting to the server:\ndbms = Sys.getenv(\"DBMS\")\nuser <- if (Sys.getenv(\"DB_USER\") == \"\") NULL else Sys.getenv(\"DB_USER\")\npassword <- if (Sys.getenv(\"DB_PASSWORD\") == \"\") NULL else Sys.getenv(\"DB_PASSWORD\")\nserver = Sys.getenv(\"DB_SERVER\")\nport = Sys.getenv(\"DB_PORT\")\nconnectionDetails <- DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails(dbms = dbms,\n                                                                server = server,\n                                                                user = user,\n                                                                password = password,\n                                                                port = port)\n````\n4. You will first need to run the `CohortDiagnostics` package on your entire database. This package is used as a diagnostic to provide transparency into the concept prevalence in your database as it relates to the concept sets and phenotypes we've prepared for the Target, Stratum and Features included in this analysis. We encourage sites to share this information so that we can help design better studies that capture the nuance of your local care delivery and coding practices.\n\n````\n# Run cohort diagnostics -----------------------------------\nrunCohortDiagnostics(connectionDetails = connectionDetails,\n                     cdmDatabaseSchema = cdmDatabaseSchema,\n                     cohortDatabaseSchema = cohortDatabaseSchema,\n                     cohortStagingTable = cohortStagingTable,\n                     oracleTempSchema = oracleTempSchema,\n                     cohortIdsToExcludeFromExecution = cohortIdsToExcludeFromExecution,\n                     exportFolder = outputFolder,\n                     #cohortGroupNames = c(\"target\", \"outcome\", \"strata\"), # Optional - will use all groups by default\n                     databaseId = databaseId,\n                     databaseName = databaseName,\n                     databaseDescription = databaseDescription,\n                     minCellCount = minCellCount)\n````\n\nthis package may take some time to run. This is normal. Allow at least 3 hours for this step. Package runtime will vary based on your infrastructure. We appreciate your patience!\n\nWhen the package is completed, you can view the `CohortDiagnostics` output in a local Shiny viewer:\n````\n# Use the next command to review cohort diagnostics and replace \"target\" with\n# one of these options: \"target\", \"outcome\", \"strata\"\n# CohortDiagnostics::launchDiagnosticsExplorer(file.path(outputFolder, \"diagnostics\", \"target\"))\n````\n\nIf it looks good, you can upload the results to the OHDSI server:\n```\n# For uploading the results. You should have received the key file from the study coordinator, input the correct path here:\nkeyFileName <- \"[key location: e.g. ~/.ssh/study-data-site-pioneer]\"\nuserName <- \"study-data-site-pioneer\" # do not change this, it is linked to the key you have\nuploadDiagnosticsResults(outputFolder, keyFileName, userName)\n```\n\n5. Once you have run `CohortDiagnostics` you are encouraged to reach out to the study leads to review your outputs. \n\n6. You can now run the characterization package. This step is designed to take advantage of incremental building. This means if the job fails, the R package will start back up where it left off. This package has been designed to be computationally efficient. Package runtime will vary based on your infrastructure but it should be significantly faster than your prior CohortDiagnostic run.\n\nIn your `R` script, you will use the following code:\n````\n# Use this to run the study. The results will be stored in a zip file called \n# 'Results_<databaseId>.zip in the outputFolder. \nrunStudy(connectionDetails = connectionDetails,\n         cdmDatabaseSchema = cdmDatabaseSchema,\n         cohortDatabaseSchema = cohortDatabaseSchema,\n         cohortStagingTable = cohortStagingTable,\n         cohortTable = cohortTable,\n         featureSummaryTable = featureSummaryTable,\n         oracleTempSchema = cohortDatabaseSchema,\n         exportFolder = outputFolder,\n         databaseId = databaseId,\n         databaseName = databaseName,\n         databaseDescription = databaseDescription,\n         #cohortGroups = c(\"target\", \"outcome\", \"strata\"), # Optional - will use all groups by default\n         cohortIdsToExcludeFromExecution = cohortIdsToExcludeFromExecution,\n         cohortIdsToExcludeFromResultsExport = cohortIdsToExcludeFromResultsExport,\n         incremental = TRUE,\n         useBulkCharacterization = useBulkCharacterization,\n         minCellCount = minCellCount) \n  ````\n\n7. You can now look at the characterization output in a local Shiny application:\n````\npreMergeResultsFiles(outputFolder)\nlaunchShinyApp(outputFolder)\n````\n\n8. If the study code runs to completion, your outputFolder will have the following contents:\n- RecordKeeping = a folder designed to store incremental information such that if the study code dies, it will restart where it left off\n- cohort.csv: An export of the cohort definitions used in the study. This is simply a cross reference for the other files and does not contain sensitive information.\n- _**cohort_count.csv**_: Contains the list of target and strata cohorts in the study with their counts. The fields `cohort_entries` and cohort_subjects` contain the number of people in the cohort. \n- _**cohort_staging_count.csv**_: Contains a full list of all cohorts produced by the code in the study inclusive of features. The fields `cohort_entries` and cohort_subjects` contain the number of people in the cohort. \n- covariate.csv: A list of features that were identified in the analyzed cohorts. This is a cross reference file with names and does not contain sensitive information.\n- _**covariate_value.csv**_: Contains the statistics produced by the study. The field `mean` will contain the proportion computed. When censored, you will see negative values in this field. \n- database.csv: Contains metadata information that you supplied as part of running the package to identify the database across the OHDSI network. Additionally, the vocabulary version used in your CDM is included.\n- **_feature_proportion.csv_**: This file contains the list of feature proportions calculated through the combination of target/stratified and features. The fields `total_count`,`feature_count`, contain the subject counts for the cohort and feature respectively. The field `mean` contains the proportion of `feature_count/total_count`. \n\nThose files noted in **_bold italics_** above should be reviewed for sensitive information for your site. The package will censor values based on the `minCellCount` parameter specified when calling the `runStudy` function. Censored values will be represented with a negative to show it has been censored. In the case of the fields `cohort_entries` and cohort_subjects`, this will be -5 (where 5=your min cell count specified). In the case of the `mean` field, this will be a negative representation of that proportion that was censored.\n\nAs a data owner, you will want to inspect these files for adherence to the minCellCount you input. You may find that only some files are generated. If this happens, please reach out to the study leads to debug. \n\n9. To utilize the `OhdsiSharing` library to connect and upload results to the OHDSI STFP server, you will need a site key. You may reach out to the study leads to get a key file. You will store this key file in a place that is retrievable by your `R`/`RStudio` environment (e.g. on your desktop if local `R` or uploaded to a folder in the cloud for `RServer`)\n\nOnce you have checked results, you can use the following code to send:\n````\n# For uploading the results. You should have received the key file from the study coordinator:\n#keyFileName <- \"[key location: e.g. ~/.ssh/study-data-site-pioneer]\"\n#userName <- \"study-data-site-pioneer\" # do not change this, it is linked to the key you have\nuploadStudyResults(outputFolder, keyFileName, userName)\n````\n"
