If you\u2019ve found a\nbug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal \n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*  We are using the Git commit workflow found here: \nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow  \n*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR) and keep\nissues addressed to one issue per branch.  \n*  Look at the git workflow checks before and after making changes.\nThe `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used\nby the package.  \n*  We recommend the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).\nYou can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to\napply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with \nyour PR.  \n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2).  \n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions\nwith test cases included are easier to accept.  \n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the\ncurrent development version header describing the changes made followed by your\nGitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the DataPackageR project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to this\nproject you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n### See rOpenSci [contributing guide](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/contributingguide.html)\nfor further details.\n\n### Style pointers for vignettes\n\n* Headings are in sentence case and contain a period at the end of the heading when appropriate.\n* Conjunctions are excluded from text.\n* Multiline function calls use the following whitespace schema:\n\n``` R\nmyFunction <- aFunctionCall(\n  input1 = \"this\",\n  input2 = \"that\"\n)\n```\n\n* Vignette file names are snake cased with capital first letters: Like_This.Rmd\n* Vignette `VignetteIndexEntry` are in sentence case: My new vignette\n\n### Discussion forum\n\nCheck out our [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org) if you think your issue requires a longer form discussion.\n\n### Prefer to Email? \n\nEmail the person listed as maintainer in the `DESCRIPTION` file of this repo.\n\nThough note that private discussions over email don't help others - of course email is totally warranted if it's a sensitive problem of any kind.\n\n### Thanks for contributing!\n\nThis contributing guide is adapted from the tidyverse contributing guide available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-lib/usethis/master/inst/templates/tidy-contributing.md \n"

This can dissuade many\n  individuals, particularly new users who have never built an R package,\n  from going this route. \n  Setting up and building R data packages by hand is a workable solution\n  for a small project or a small number of projects, but when dealing\n  with many projects each involving many data sets, tools are needed to\n  help automate the process. \nDataPackageR provides a number of benefits when packaging your data. \n- It aims to automate away much of the tedium of packaging data sets\n  without getting too much in the way, and keeps your processing\n  workflow reproducible. \n- It sets up the necessary package structure and files for a data\n  package. \n- It allows you to keep the large, raw data and only ship the packaged\n  tidy data, saving space and time consumers of your data set need to\n  spend downloading and re-processing it. \n- It maintains a reproducible record (vignettes) of the data processing\n  along with the package. Consumers of the data package can verify how\n  the processing was done, increasing confidence in your data. \n- It automates construction of the documentation and maintains a data\n  set version and an md5 fingerprint of each data object in the package.\n  If the data changes and the package is rebuilt, the data version is\n  automatically updated.\n \n"

        "value": "**Definition:** A *data package* is a formal R package whose sole\npurpose is to contain, access, and / or document data sets.\n\n- **Reproducibility.**\n\n  As described [elsewhere](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg),\n  packaging your data promotes reproducibility. R\u2019s packaging\n  infrastructure promotes unit testing, documentation, a reproducible\n  build system, and has many other benefits. Coopting it for packaging\n  data sets is a natural fit.\n\n- **Collaboration.**\n\n  A data set packaged in R is easy to distribute and share among\n  collaborators, and is easy to install and use. All the hard work\n  you\u2019ve put into documenting and standardizing the tidy data set comes\n  right along with the data package.\n\n- **Documentation.**\n\n  R\u2019s package system allows us to document data objects. What\u2019s more,\n  the `roxygen2` package makes this very easy to do with [markup\n  tags](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html). That documentation is the\n  equivalent of a data dictionary and can be extremely valuable when\n  returning to a project after a period of time.\n\n- **Convenience.**\n\n  Data pre-processing can be time consuming, depending on the data type\n  and raw data sets may be too large to share conveniently in a packaged\n  format. Packaging and sharing the small, tidied data saves the users\n  computing time and time spent waiting for downloads.\n"

These data sets can be\nstored in `inst/extdata` of the data package source tree, or elsewhere\noutside the package source tree. In order to have portable and\nreproducible code, you should not use absolute paths to the raw data.\nInstead, `DataPackageR` provides several APIs to access the data package\nproject root directory, the `inst/extdata` subdirectory, and the `data`\nsubdirectory.\n\n``` r\n# This returns the datapackage source\n# root directory.\n# In an R or Rmd processing script this can be used to build a path to a directory that is exteral to the package, for\n# example if we are dealing with very large data sets where data cannot be packaged.\nDataPackageR::project_path()\n\n# This returns the\n# inst/extdata directory.\n# Raw data sets that are included in the package should be placed there.\n# They can be read from that location, which is returned by:\nDataPackageR::project_extdata_path()\n\n# This returns the path to the datapackage\n# data directory. This can be used to access\n# stored data objects already created and saved in `data` from\n# other processing scripts.\nDataPackageR::project_data_path()\n```\n"
